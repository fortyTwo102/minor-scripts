        "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #141 on Isaiah Berlin. Check out the episode page HERE.So if there's a way to sum up the END of last episode... that can get us started in the right direction this episode... it's to say that to the philosopher Isaiah Berlin: these attempts ALL throughout history... to create systems of values based on a single criteria...to synthesize multiple different systems of values into one UNIVERSAL system...these have all been grounded in an assumption spanning across the entire history of human thought...that there is a single, correct answer to any question you can ask...that there is a clear methodology we can use to get us there, usually reason or revelation...and that once we find these answers they are going to fit neatly into a single overarching system, a cohesive worldview that fits together like some sort of cosmic jigsaw puzzle.Now ALL of this is to say that Isaiah Berlin wants to set his sights on the long tradition we have in the west of using Monism, to develop systems of thought that use a SINGLE, ULTIMATE criteria for determining the TRUTH, about political or moral values. Let me say it again because it's important: The use of these systems to determine the truth about moral or political values is one of his primary concerns. This is a dangerous game we've been playing and it's had bloody consequences in the 20th century...and his response to Monism comes from the thinkers of the Counter-Enlightenment...something he calls Pluralism, or the idea...that when it comes to values... there are multiple different ends that people can arrive at...using the EXACT SAME process of rationality...and that BOTH conclusions, can nonetheless be intelligible and rational, simultaneously.The complexity of human experience makes questions of political or moral values destined to have blurry answers. The values of a person or culture are extremely complicated, they overlap, they contradict each other, they're situational, inconsistent...the values of people are often what he calls incomensurable. Now...let's talk about that big word incommensurable and give some real examples for why he thinks this is the way things are.Classic example that's used here to introduce this concept is the relationship between mercy and justice and how it can seem deceptively simple when we think about it. Now, there being a sense of MERCY in the world and there being a sense of JUSTICE in the world are both important values that a person or culture can prioritize...but consider the fact that in practice...these two values of mercy and justice can often butt heads competing, when trying to be considered at the same time.Consider for a second a real world example where these values interact. The easiest is to think about a hypothetical criminal justice system. Now, there are examples out there of people that find themselves in trouble... who are otherwise good citizens... who made a fleeting poor decision in a moment...and as people we might value there being some sort of mercy exercised in this case...we don't want the book thrown at everyone, we don't want to bury every person under the jail that makes a mistake, and here's the important part: for a person to come to this conclusion would be ENTIRELY rational.Now on the OTHER hand... there are examples of people out there that are CLEARLY hurting the people around them...these are the people the criminal justice system is designed to rehabilitate...and you could EASILY find people who have a strong set of values... that think these sorts of people should be punished to the full extent of the law. There are people out there that value a strong implementation of the virtue of justice, and once again it's important to note...this would be an entirely RATIONAL conclusion for someone to arrive at.Well Isaiah Berlin might ask: which approach is better? Say we're creating a hypothetical criminal justice system...should that system go for mercy at all costs? Or justice at all costs? No doubt it's a combination of both...OK, well what criteria do we use to determine how much mercy we should use and how much justice we should use?His whole point here is that you can never answer this question clearly with some single criterion or single maxim. The fact is the true complexity of human experience makes this impossible. Monism CANNOT EVER adequately mediate the relationship between complex human values like mercy and justice. The mistake of the thinkers of the past has been to try to try to come up with some SINGLE STANDARD that addresses all the complexities of billions of people living together...the goal of the justice system should be to MAXIMIZE FREEDOM...or BALANCE THE SCALES...these overly-ambitious GOLDEN RULES are utterly useless.. when it comes to truly sifting through the blurry, complex relationship between human values like mercy and justice. But it should be said this applies to so many other examples of human values that butt heads...for example, liberty and total equality. Because if men were wholly free, he says, then the wolves would be free to eat the sheep. How about Spontanaeity vs planning and organization, we want both of those in our lives. Knowledge and freedom. Peace and excitement. The examples he provides are endless.But regardless of which one you're talking about though there is no SINGLE blueprint that can ever tell us how much mercy and how much justice....to Isaiah Berlin the fact is people and cultures often have two hold two, what he calls incommensurable values, like mercy and justice, simultaneously. These values are sometimes totally incompatible. They sometimes overlap in weird ways. When you abandon the strategy of trying to find a way that billions of human beings can be fit into a neat little package governed by a SINGLE maxim...then you encounter what Isaiah Berlin sees as the true Pluralism that lies at the foundation of human values.But just to be clear this incommensurability of values doesn't JUST exist at a political or social level where we have to deal with lots of different people...THIS IS THE WAY our values work at an INDIVIDUAL level as well.We know this...because when was the last time you met someone who talks about themselves like, \"I am a totally MERCILESS human being towards EVERYONE.\" But you'd be EQUALLY hard pressed to find someone that describes themselves like, \"Well schucks I don't care about justice at all...I think everybody should just get away with everything ALL THE TIME!\" To hold the values of mercy AND justice at some level simultaneously SEEMS to be where most people live their lives. You NEED to if you're going to have any level of nuance to your thinking at all, and the most under nuanced approach to thinking in the history of the world is Monism.So this is why any attempt to distill the true plurality of human values down into a single maxim always fails miserably in the long run. Some ultimate RULE that everyone should follow: Do not unto others as you wouldn't like done unto you. Or some overarching theory of billions of people...there's winners and losers in this world. Human values, ESPECIALLY when it comes to our values in action in the political realm...are never that simple.There is ALWAYS a balance we are finding with our values between certain polarities. And it's important to clarify here that this is NOT JUST a problem that Isaiah Berlin had with the Enlightenment. If that were the case he might be lumped into a group with the MANY anti-Enlightenment thinkers throughout the 20th century, several of which we've talked about on this show. What makes Isaiah Berlin TRULY special is that his more fundamental problem was with Monism, and that was a legacy of our thought that he STILL saw all around him in the thinkers of his time...interestingly...even the ones that were railing against the Enlightenment. Perfect example of this was his early work where he took extreme issue with the Logical Positivists.So if you remember from our episode the Logical Positivists were an early twentieth century group practically DEFINED by their opposition to Metaphysics. They were critical of the Enlightenment in the sense that they were trying to correct what they saw as the primary MISTAKE of the Enlightenment...philosophers using REASON to arrive at all sorts of conclusions in the realm of metaphysics that ultimately amounted to unverifiable speculation. To them this is how rationality could've ever gotten us so off track.So their solution to this was to triple down on verificationism, or the principle of verification, or the idea: that something is meaningful or can reasonably contribute to knowledge ONLY if it is verifiable. This took the form of A priori and A posteriori propositions and we've explained them so many times I'm not going to waste time with an explanation here, just go back and listen to the episode if you need it.But the larger point is this is yet another example to Isaiah Berlin of trying to come up with a single strategy for determining the validity of human thoughts or affairs. And he gives many different examples of this in his critiques of the Logical Positivists. One of the more famous ones is... let's say that it rained yesterday. Well the fact that it rained yesterday is NOT something that is verifiable. There's no a priori deduction we can do to prove it...and there is no way we can go outside and immediately experience the fact it rained yesterday empirically. Switch the example to it rained ten years ago if it helps.But nonetheless the fact that it rained yesterday...is TRUE. And that information could be extremely meaningful to our lives as people and informing our decisions. The problem was Monism...the problem was the Logical Positivists trying to reduce humanity to a single principle. Had they taken a more Pluralistic approach who knows what they could have done.Now a common rebuttal to Berlin has always been...that Pluralism...is really just relativism in disguise. Remember thinkers like Leo Strauss who talked about how because modernity focuses so hard on being value-neutral when trying to understand the world the end game every single time was going to be some form of relativism, historicism, nihilism, scientism...some way to remove values from the equation altogether or give ultimate authority to some area of society, science or economics to DETERMINE our values for us. So something people have said about Berlin is that pluralism is not anything new...just the classic, well-known rebuttal to the Enlightenment naively trying to use reason to arrive at values. But remember how we began this two parter! Berlin was setting out to find a bridge between nature and culture...BETWEEN as it were the strategy of the Enlightenment and the strategy of these early 20th century thinkers...to be able to clearly define the lines of which aspects of our values are human nature and which of them can be explained by culture or the place we happen to be living in within history.This is why Isaiah Berlin is NOT a relativist. He believes that there are certain values that are common among all people regardless of culture.He lays out his basic argument here in his book \"The Crooked Timber of Humanity\", and he begins by referencing a couple of common passages from the history of philosophy that have been used to JUSTIFY arguments for a PURE relativism or PURE historicism...then he goes on to give a clarification that explains his position:\"It is true that a Sophist quoted by Aristotle thought that fire burns both here and in Persia, but what is thought just changes before our very eyes; and that Montesquieu thinks that one should wear warm clothes in cold climates and thin garments in hot ones, and that Persian customs would not suit the inhabitants of Paris. But what this kind of plea for variety comes to is that different means are most effective in different circumstances towards the realization of similar ends. This is true even of the notorious skeptic David Hume. None of these doubters wish to deny that the central human goals are universal and uniform, even though they may not be necessarily established a priori: all men seek food and drink, shelter and security; all men want to procreate; all men seek social intercourse, justice, a degree of liberty, means of self-expression and the like. The means towards these ends may differ from country to country, and age to age, but the ends whether alterable in principle or not, remain unaltered\"So what is he saying here? He's saying that there may be a LOT of stuff out there that is culturally or historically determined...the specific MEANS, a particular culture might use, to get to THEIR desired ends. The way these customs look to us from culture to culture might vary enormously...but nonetheless it's almost impossible to make a case for the fact that our cultures, aren't, ALL AIMING for VERY similar ends. Human beings seem to generally want very similar things...we've just found different creative ways to get there, and those specific ways, will vary, based on the culture that you happen to be born into.Now you may hear that and think he's making the very basic statement that all cultures are different, and we all want to eat, sleep and have a sense of freedom in our life...but there's actually multiple layers to what he's saying here. This is Pluralism... applied to the relationships that exist between different cultures. The TRUE significance of what he's saying here is that... there's no way you can use rationality to arrive at some SUPER-CULTURE, that's better than all the other cultures, but this is so often the subtext that's present when people have conversations between cultures... and WITHIN cultures.The subtext is that as long as we all appeal to rationality and have enough discussions with each other...that eventually it's not crazy to think that we will all agree about everything...or at least every RATIONAL person will have the same opinion. Consider a few examples to compliment this point and then we'll expand on this a lot more.Now on one hand this is not a very controversial statement to make. Most people understand that people arrive at different sets of values when it comes to their personal lives and nobodies going on a crusade to say that one is inherently less rational than another. For example, imagine one lifestyle...imagine a person that looks out at the world and thinks of it as a very dangerous place. Well, in many ways the world IS a very dangerous place...lotta buses to get hit by...lotta diseases to contract...lotta meteors to dodge as they fall out of the sky...so this person that sees all that danger decides...that the rational conclusion they should live by is to stay inside most of the time. They enjoy their life inside...they practice enjoying a level of peace most people never get to experience that are out in the dangers of the world...they have a level of privacy to their life that is just far greater than someone who immerses themselves in the public realm. People may disagree...but hard to make a REAL case that this isn't an intelligible, rational conclusion someone could arrive at.Now consider another person who's one of those energy drink wing suit people...flying through a canyon like a squirrel...puts on a go pro when they go to the gas station...this person might look out at that same dangerous world and think look...the world I was born into IS danger. What am I going to hide from it my entire life? No, I'm not going to live my life... viewing other people around me as merely catalysts of danger. Something to avoid. There is more to life than spending my life cooped up inside feeling safe just because I happen to be alive. I'm going to go out and live, and if it's my time to go at least I can die knowing I had a good run. Now again...people may disagree...but even the extreme recluse from the previous example could look at this person...be TOLERANT of the fact that they have come to different conclusions and even have a level of respect for them accepting they just value different things.But Isaiah Berlin would want us to juxtapose this entire line of thinking over into the political realm. How often do people engaging in a political discussion look at their political opposition...hear an argument that disagrees with them...and then act tolerant of that disagreement...respectful of the person because they see them as an intelligible, rational human being that, just has a different set of values because they come from a different set of experiences...how often does that happen, vs how often do people adopt this attitude of Monism where there is a single correct answer, a methodology they've arrived at to attain it, and a cohesive, sweeping worldview informed by those correct answers? How often when someone sees their political opposition do they just assume the other person can't POSSIBLY be rational...they must be delusional, or stupid, or indoctrinated, or evil...they must be one of these things because if they were rational...they would agree with me.Well, come on Berlin that's obviously different. Someone wants to sit inside all day or jump out of an airplane they're not hurting anyone but themselves...when it comes to political issues there are innocent people potentially getting hurt in the balance! NONE of this is to say that we should all be holding hands singing campfire songs together all the time. Isaiah Berlin makes it VERY CLEAR...we're GOING to have political disagreements. Heated ones. Were GOING to embark on political campaigns to try to win the hearts and minds of people towards OUR OWN set of values. The question is not whether or not we should disagree...the question is whether or not WHEN you disagree you wouldn't feel all that bad about putting a bike lock in a sock and beating someone over the head with it at a political rally because they're part of some evil herd of sheep that disagrees with you.See the change from Monism to Pluralism is subtle...it changes the way you view people who disagree with you.Because when you recognize the pluralistic nature of human values you realize that there is no single correct answer and even if there was rationality is not the tool that is going to get us there. The idea...that if only we have more rational discussions about things eventually everybody rational will agree on the same values...is a misunderstanding of what rationality is producing for us. Rationality is just utterly incapable of SOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS that can exist between cultures that value different things. One example Isaiah Berlin gives of this has to do with religious differences.Just imagine a devout believer in Orphism and a devout believer in Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism going out to coffee together...and they're going to sit down and have a rational discussion about their values and the goal of either of them is to try to convince the other of the TRUE political reality of the world. Do you think rational discussion is going to be the thing to change either of their minds about values?Isaiah Berlin might say good on them both for trying. He wouldn't be surprised if rational discussion wasn't the tool that was going to convince someone that someone ELSE had the truth about things. But most of all he'd want to say that any sort of violence that may have come out of that discussion...any sort of hatred of the other...would ALWAYS COME from some attitude associated with Monism. Political violence rises proportional to the level of intolerance within a society. See tolerance and empathy are very HUMAN characteristics. Berlin goes so far as to say the people that LACK the ability to be empathetic, serial killers and the like, seem to lack something crucial about what it is to be human. We should make it a priority. And JUST as we would do well...to look at other cultures that disagree with us, have a bit of tolerance and try to relate to the common humanity that exists between us, try to understand WHY they believe what they do based on their own unique past...we would do just as well to treat fellow members of our society with that same respect...even if they disagree.So often what SEEMS on the surface like a totally different set of rituals between cultures ends up being the same, very human, moral intuition manifesting itself in two different ways...and this even happens all the time between people of the SAME culture who claim to hold very different values.There's a TED talk that was done by Johnathan Haidt in 2008 where he gives an example of this. Take the very human value of purity. For some reason purity seems to matter across the board to human beings. But even within the same culture you might see one type of person that deeply values purity in a religious sense...chastity before marriage, purity from the hedonistic behaviors that might pollute your spiritual well being. But you may see another type of person that values purity by eating only organic, locally sourced, ethically produced ingredients...or purity when it comes to the environment. This is just one example of how the SAME moral intuition can manifest itself in two VERY DIFFERENT WAYS, and yet...there seems to be some common humanity underlying this value and its possible these two very different people could find some level of tolerance for the other if they took the time to try to understand. They could understand BOTH PARTS of a human being...those values determined by nature...and the ones determined by their culture.This is the TRUE ROLE, of rationality for Isaiah Berlin. When it comes to moral and political values...we're never going to agree on everything. Rationality cannot give us that...but what it CAN do is mediate the differences BETWEEN different moral systems and allow us to be tolerant of each other. You don't go to war with another culture just because they value something you don't...you can disagree, try to understand the best you can...but you don't think they're stupid or evil just because they don't do everything the way you do. The same way rationality can regulate the relationships between cultures it can regulate the relationships between people.Carl Schmitt...political philosopher and member of the third Reich from earlier in this 20th century political arc...he was famously critical of Liberalism as a massively failed experiment that leads to weak societies. For all the tolerance, multi-culturalism, and limits on government power...he saw all of these things instantly get thrown out the minute a TRUE political disagreement came to pass. People can be tolerant of insignificant things, but the minute it becomes something that they really care about even Liberal societies descend into bloodshed and violence.Well here is Isaiah Berlin years later presenting an entirely new TYPE of Liberal thought. That is, Liberal Pluralism. Maybe its NOT a fundamental part of human nature to descend into violence whenever political differences get really serious. Maybe this is a TYPE of thinking that we've inherited that has been so ingrained into every theory that's come before that even a doctrine of tolerance and multiculturalism like Liberalism was created with it in mind. Maybe Monism...and the monolithic type of thinking that comes along with it...maybe the belief that there is a single answer to every question out there has allowed people to treat their fellow human beings as the other, simply because they come from a different part of the city where different values keep them alive, or a different part of the country or a different part of the world...sometimes ideas come up at points throughout the history of human thought...ideas that practically everyone at the time is downright enamored with. THIS NEW INSIGHT is the solution to all our problems as a species. Sometimes just five, ten years later there's a NEW set of ideas that comes along rebuking it...and as quickly as it came the idea everyone was crazy about is never heard from again. Well the Enlightenment was no doubt one of the times people were excited about an idea and it was left to play out. But what if Isaiah Berlin, as a historian of ideas, what if he was right? What if the Pluralism of the counter Enlightenment could have been a moment when we realized a HUGE ASSUMPTION we'd all been making in our thinking? What might the 20th century have looked like...if we had listened to, and been tolerant of ideas ALL THE WAY BACK THEN...that made us uneasy.Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n"

        "title": "Richard Rorty",
        "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #142 on Richard Rorty. Check out the episode page HERE.So if you were having a political discussion with someone...and the conversation took a turn and all of a sudden you're talking about human rights...there's certainly, a lot of angles you could approach that discussion from, but one of the most common ones might be what, philosophical grounding can we give to something like human rights?I mean we all think human beings have rights, but where exactly do those rights come from? Who or what out there, GUARANTEES these rights for people? Well a common answer to this question might be that human rights are inherited...by birthright. Simply by virtue of being born every human being is entitled to certain, natural rights or inalienable rights. Rights, that protect the dignity of a human life at such a basic level...that to go against them starts to seem like you'd be going against nature.Now as far as the philosophical grounding is concerned this is an attitude MUCH more common during the beginning of the Enlightenment than it is today...and the two MAIN thinkers that took ON this position are often cited to be John Locke and Immanuel Kant. When it comes to answering the question who or what guarantees these human rights...John Locke goes in the direction of God, you know...we are endowed by our CREATOR with certain inalienable rights...and Kant goes more in the direction of A priori facts derived from reason. But either way both these thinkers are in their own way trying to use REASON to arrive at a universal that GUARANTEES human beings are BORN with natural rights. Little did EITHER of these thinkers know that just 140 years later we would be immersed in two world wars that would make the argument for the natural rights of human beings seem about as important as neck ruffles were to them.See as we've talked about on this show the early 20th century was full of thinkers dissatisfied with what the Enlightenment had produced. They even went so far as to say that the entire PROJECT of the Enlightenment...was destined to consume itself from the start. Yeah, sure at the beginning REASON calls into question much of the religious dogma of the middle ages...but what inevitably has to happen once it gets done with THAT job...is REASON has to start questioning the NEW foundations for things...reason has to start questioning...itself. Which, then leads to philosophers USING the process of rationality...to find out that rationality is not some unbiased, ahistorical measuring tool...it's not some \"neutral point\" from which we can make unambiguous claims about the TRUTH about human rights or more importantly, THE UNIVERSE. To the thinker we're going to be covering today, Richard Rorty...people like Locke and Kant were NO MORE discovering a Truth about what grounds human rights than Hammurabi was before them. But UNLIKE many of the thinkers of the early 20th century...who may have felt a bit disenfranchised by the rational process...Richard Rorty felt optimistic about rationality.Some people called Rorty a postmodernist...which would USUALLY place him in staunch opposition to anything that even SOUNDS like the word Enlightenment. Like EXCITEMENT! But let me tell ya...Rorty was a VERY exciting man. He REJECTED the title of postmodernist and most titles for that matter. He operated in a very unique realm for a thinker where like a TYPICAL post-structuralist he didn't believe in any sort of grand narrative that could explain away the universe...but yet he was STILL...a die hard, card carrying fan...of the PROJECT of the Enlightenment overall.See in a world where there are so many 20th century thinkers hating on the Enlightenment...here is a guy some viewed as a post-structuralist, coming to its defense. Let me explain WHY he would DO something like this.When Immanuel Kant in his famous essay describes the Enlightenment as \"man's removal of his self-incurred tutelage\"...yeah, he's talking about the tutelage of the religious dogma of the past...but Rorty would EXTEND that tutelage to the RATIONAL dogma that was to come in the future because of how over-ambitious we were at the BEGINNING of the Enlightenment about what rationality could produce.The spirit of the Enlightenment, to Rorty, was not to use reason to arrive at the TRUTH about the universe...it was ultimately a call to subvert traditional forms of authority. The significance of the Enlightenment was NOT to land on new answers...it was to question old assumptions. So in that sense...yeah, the INITIAL project of the Enlightenment ultimately consumed itself, but to Richard Rorty the initial project of the Enlightenment was MEANT to consume itself.Thinkers like Isaiah Berlin that would come along and suggest a Pluralistic vision of things...this wasn't an anti-enlightenment idea at all...to Rorty...this WAS the project of the Enlightenment left to play itself out...thinkers like Berlin were ALWAYS going to eventually come along. See the project of the Enlightenment MATURING through people like Isaiah Berlin, taught us a couple of EXTREMELY valuable insights. One of which, was that we don't need to try to use reason to appeal to some ultimate authority or universal to GROUND our ideas. Rationality, is not a tool that gets us to objectivity about things...but it MAY get us to a VERY EFFECTIVE mix of inter-subjectivity between cultures.Rorty wants to offer an alternative way to look at the legacy of the Enlightenment. Maybe it IS pointless to try to do our best impressions of Locke and Kant and try to access the universe through reason...but when it comes to strictly HUMAN institutions...for example, the political realm, where we're not trying to access \"things in themselves\"...we're just trying to figure out how we can live together the best...maybe THAT is where rationality thrives as a method.What ALL of this is alluding to is the fact that human rights are not the only things philosophers have tried to GROUND in universals in the past. The very structure of some political systems, Liberalism, has ALSO historically been grounded in universals. Once again, I just want to clarify because there are some people out there that get angry VERY QUICKLY...and they also must be part of some sort of email club...when we're talking about Liberalism as a foundation for society we're talking about government with a focus on individual rights, consent of the governed and an aversion to any sort of collectivist system or systems that were more popular at other points in history, maybe a caste system for example. Now, you can imagine if you're a philosopher...and you're trying to make a case for Liberalism being BETTER than a caste system...might be tempting to start to make an argument that human beings at the level of the universe are all equal...and therefore should not be relegated to different ranks within a society. But to Rorty, this would be making the same mistake that Locke and Kant made in our example from before about human rights.The fact is to Rorty: we don't need that sort of ULTIMATE FOUNDATION to be able to make a case for the fact that Liberalism is how we should be running things. For many different reasons, one as has been said, we can't actually ACCESS the universe at that level through rationality. Two, society is just far better off when it can base public policy on the rational consensus of individual citizens rather than some philosophical theory arrived at by some guy in a tower that people might not even be able to relate to.Think of the limitations you INSTANTLY place on yourself if you decide that every public policy or VALUE of a society needs to be grounded in some philosophical justification that tells you how human beings are AT LARGE. First of all, let's say you decided to structure your society around the political philosophy of Plato...you're soon going to find yourself on a constant PR campaign trying to continually SELL these ideas to a population just crossing your fingers that they go along with it. Second of all, almost always these philosophical ideas that you might structure your society around were created in an ENTIRELY different culture that emerged out of an ENTIRELY different history, which means these theories can bring a lot of baggage along with them that you may not WANT in the present culture. Thirdly, you are ALWAYS going to be fighting a sort of losing battle to Rorty, because you will ALWAYS be trying to cram ONE interpretation of how human life should be structured into the enormously complex, pluralistic maelstrom of people coexisting together.Rorty is essentially saying maybe we don't need the philosopher up in the tower thinking all day...telling us how to structure our societies because welp I've decided it shores up with how the universe is. Maybe we don't have ACCESS to the way the universe is, but maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe we don't need some elaborate philosophical theory to structure our society for us...maybe a strategy is legitimate...Liberalism for instance...if the citizens of a particular culture, positioned in history at a particular time and place, all the citizens facing a very specific set of common problems that they need to solve as a society...maybe a strategy is legitimate if the people of that society decide that they have confidence in it.One ultimate theory is not good enough. Rorty, who was a HUGE fan of Isaiah Berlin, sometimes talks in his work about the \"fact of Pluralism\". This is WHAT a society is, to Rorty. We are WORSE OFF as a society if we try to use a single religious or philosophical theory to justify our political strategy. You will ALWAYS be fighting a losing battle...people will ALWAYS arrive at a BUNCH of different conclusions...so instead of embarking on a never ending sales campaign for an idea...Rorty suggests that we allow our political strategy to reflect the common values of the people that make up the culture. He writes about how if we do this, and we're careful, eventually if you were having that same conversation at the beginning of the episode and you asked someone what GROUNDS human rights...the common tendency WON'T be to try to appeal to something written into the universe or to cite some religious or philosophical justification you read in a book...the NEW standard will be for people to see social policy as legitimate if it was approved by the people actually LIVING in the culture. When asked the question what GROUNDS this piece of social policy...the answer won't involve pointing to some philosopher from 300 years ago...Descartes famous work: A treatise concerning why DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGALIZED and why you should be able to use your cellphone on an airplane, for instance. No, the authority lies in the hands... of the set of people positioned in history... with a very specific set of problems to solve that they care about...and once again, to Rorty, not only do we not NEED any more authority than that...we don't have ACCESS to any authority other than that, and we're better off this way anyway.Should be said this is yet another way we can access an answer to the question of how we can find a bridge between nature and culture. Rorty obviously is not appealing to a single theory, but he ALSO is not appealing to pure relativism or historicism. His answers to these questions about how we can justify our political strategy place him in what I think is the most accurate category to describe some of his biggest ideas...Rorty is often thought of as a Pragmatist, and I think we can understand Rorty's OVERALL position a little bit better if we take a second to talk about the concept of Truth...more specifically...the key differences between the traditional ways people have viewed the concept of TRUTH...and the way a Pragmatist like Rorty would've viewed the concept of Truth.So let's talk first about one of the most COMMON theories of what constitutes truth from the history of philosophy...one that Richard Rorty thought has been dominant since the very beginning of the Enlightenment...what he sometimes calls the representationalist paradigm...sometimes called by others the correspondence theory of truth...but let ME take a second to tell you what it actually is.The most basic idea is that suppose somebody says a statement about the way that things are in the world. How do we tell if that statement is true? Well that statement is true if it REPRESENTS the way things really ARE in the world. If there is a CORRESPONDENCE between the description and reality, then we can say it's true. Now...there is of course mountains of detail that we could talk about here but Richard Rorty disagrees with the entire PREMISE of the correspondence theory even at this basic, rudimentary level.Whenever you try to create a bridge...between a description you have in your head...and the reality of the world that you're looking at...the only way you can ever describe ANYTHING...is through language. Language MEDIATES our relationship with reality. You can't access reality WITHOUT language. But to Rorty it goes even one step further than this. Not only is language a medium between us and reality...but language actually CONSTITUTES reality. Meaning that the language we use and the way we use it CHANGES the way we THINK about reality.This could be an entire series on its own...but the point is that certain languages and the cultures that use them favor certain habits of interpreting events. These interpretations greatly determine the entire way we see reality and the WAY human beings perceive reality varies greatly from culture to culture, language to language. So the idea...that there is some sort of correspondence or representation going on... that the world out there is somehow helping us verify whether statements are true or false...that's just wrong...because Rorty thinks it would be impossible for us to ever step outside of the parameters of language and access the world of things in themselves, things independent of this language that we use to categorize them.He has a very famous quote that will be EXTREMELY useful for us for the remainder of the episode. He said:\"The world does not speak. only we do. the world can, once we have programmed ourselves with a language, cause us to hold beliefs. But it cannot propose a language for us to speak. Only human beings can do that.\"So it should be said, Rorty's not talking about ordinary language when he writes that...he's talking about something else that we're going to get deep into here in a minute. But I want to point out that this comparison that he's making here...between accessing \"the world\" vs some sort of human created tool that is deeply affected by the bonds of history and culture...this is a classic move that Rorty makes that, if you were NEW to Rorty, might help you understand an outline of some of the topics he wants to cover.For example, language is EXTREMELY useful in human affairs...it's just not capable of describing the world of things in themselves outside of language. Consider how this compares to the beginning of the episode. We have Locke and Kant trying to use reason to access some sort of ultimate TRUTH about the universe...but here's Rorty saying that rationality is the MOST useful in HUMAN affairs like the realm of the political. The WORLD does not speak, only we do. Here's another one from the Enlightenment...people like Rousseau...who believe in some sort of underlying human nature, Noble Savages as he would say...or really beyond that ANYONE that wants to take up the mantle of the common attitude that human beings at their very core DREAD seeing other human beings suffer. That's a common one for people to hold...that NATURALLY as human beings we don't want to see other people in pain, so we can RELY on the fact that if things ever got bad enough one culture would always come to the aid of another culture.Rorty actually responds to this position directly in an interaction with Simon Critchley in the 90's. So right here he is referencing the idea that there is some sort of default altruism embedded into human nature...he says:\u201cMaybe there is such a sentient disposition, but it is so malleable \u2013 so capable of being combined with indifference to the suffering of people of the wrong sorts \u2013 that it gives us precious little to rely on. We should just thank our lucky stars that there are quite a lot of people nowadays who are pretty consistently appalled by human beings suffering unnecessarily.\u201dSo he's saying MAYBE THERE IS some aspect of human nature that makes people not want to see others suffer, but if there is it's incredibly malleable. Thank your lucky stars that there happen to be a lot of people living today who don't want to see unnecessary suffering. But ALSO...if you're a fan of Liberalism...there is nothing written into nature like a God or A Priori facts that say LIBERALISM is the way...but thank your lucky stars for the last couple hundred years there have been a lot of people that believe in it as a strategy. So while we can understand the MOVE that Rorty's making here, placing a lot of authority in the hands of the people actually immersed in the culture...this may start to bring up a whole NEW set of questions. One of the most pressing might be this:So if the authority of whether a social policy is good or not lies in the hands of the citizens...and not even a PHILOSOPHER can arrive at absolute foundations for even something as simple as human rights...don't those criticisms just instantly extend to my beliefs as an individual? Like, how am I supposed to ground my worldview in ANYTHING that is enduring enough that I can feel confident about it?The short answer to this question is that: you can't. And that shouldn't bother you. The longer answer can be found in Rorty's lengthy exploration of the concept of irony. Let's talk about it right now.So a common email I get is from a person who says something to the effect of this: Hi, I've been listening to the show for a while, I've heard about a bunch of different philosophers...and I've gotten to a place where I feel the complexity of things makes me feel pretty uncertain about choosing a worldview...sometimes I feel agnostic about almost every issue of substance I can think of...but this creates a problem for me because I still need to operate in day to day life. How is it possible to live a life where you're RADICALLY uncertain about things, but still capable of functioning on an every day level?There are many answers to this question but Richard Rorty offers one of them through his discussion about living a life as an \"ironist\". Now by ironist he doesn't mean that you're smelting metal down at the Home Depot everyday...the term ironist is a reference to irony. To fully understand the life of an ironist, though, we first need to understand the much more common almost ubiquitous way that people approach figuring things out about the world...a way of thinking deeply embedded in the history of philosophy.Most people view their intellectual development as a person as a linear progression of moving PAST appearances...and getting to the REALITY of the world. This goes all the way back to Plato's allegory of the Cave...shadows on a cave wall, we do the work of a philosopher and eventually can ascend OUT of the cave and see the sun, or TRUE knowledge, for what it actually is. Well this way of viewing ourselves has been a fixture in our cultures for so long that it is the way that MANY people see their process of growth when learning about the world. There's this intuitive sense that we're born, we're young, dumb, naive...we get information from our teachers, parents, basic news sources and there's a sense in which we are living in a world of appearances at that point. See it's not until we've done the work of reading five newspapers a day, 1000 books, traveled to 100 countries...not until we've done THAT can we say that we've arrived at a worldview that sees reality on reality's terms.But just as there's no SINGLE THEORY embedded into the universe about human rights, or political strategy or ANYTHING for that matter...there's no single, correct view of existence that you're somehow accessing through life experiences and reading a bunch of stuff. You may THINK that you have a rational justification for every view that you hold...you may think it's the greatest worldview that has ever been created...but it was created...by you...BY a human being...and Rorty would say that although we often DECEIVE ourselves into THINKING it's the truth...really what we've created here is what he calls a final vocabulary. More on final vocabularies in one second but first I think it would be helpful to hear Rorty talk about a key distinction between someone saying \"the world is out there\" and saying \"the truth is out there\" and how these statements ultimately relate to language.\"we need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is out there and the claim that the truth is out there. To say that the world is out there, that it is not our creation, is to say, with common sense, that most things in space and time are the effects of causes which do not include human mental states. To say that truth is not out there is simply to say that where there are no sentences there is no truth, that sentences are elements of human languages, and that human languages are human creations. Truth cannot be out there \u2013 cannot exist independently of the human mind \u2013 because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. The world is out there, but descriptions of the world are not. Only descriptions of the world can be true or false. The world on its own \u2013 unaided by the describing activities of human beings \u2013 cannot.\"This is one of Rorty's most famous concepts. What many refer to as the distinction between making and finding. Locke and Kant are not FINDING the truth about human rights...they are using a very human process called REASON to MAKE a truth about human rights that we'd then use to structure our societies. Liberalism was not FOUND to be the best political strategy...historical circumstances and common values among people MADE it the best political strategy for a time. When you read a thousand books you are not FINDING the truth about existence, you are MAKING a final vocabulary that allows you to interface with reality during the specific time that you happen to be living.By final vocabulary Rorty means a collection of stories, metaphors, narratives, discourses, tons of different tools of rhetoric... that you use to make sense of the world and see your place in it. This is called a FINAL vocabulary because the things that make it up are very final...they're probably not going to develop any further because when it comes down to it...if you were pressed hard enough to explain your worldview by somebody skilled enough at arguing, with enough time on their hands...Rorty says eventually there would be no way for you to explain why YOUR worldview is better anyone else's in a non-circular way. It is a courageous thing to fight and die for your country...because look, fighting for your country and dying is one of the most courageous things you can do! The Bible is true, so you should trust the word of God.When pressed hard enough to justify your worldview in a conversation these are the sorts of stories and metaphors that ground the values of someone who thinks they've got it all figured out. Many people spend their entire lives thinking they've arrived at the truth...when the more accurate description is that they've set up camp in an echo chamber of people that don't call them on their mistakes...either because they only talk to people who mostly agree with them, or because the people that disagree with them lack the ability to press them further, maybe they want to just be polite, maybe they just don't CARE enough about changing someone into a LITTLE version of them to spend their time doing it.Rorty prescribes an antidote to this way of thinking about getting past appearances to the reality of the world. Here is a pretty famous passage from his work that describes his three criteria for living a life as an ironist:\"I shall define an ironist as someone who fulfills three conditions: 1 She has radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses, because she has be impressed by other vocabularies, vocabularies taken as final by people or books she has encountered; 2 She realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts. 3 insofar as she philosophizes about her situation, she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others, that it is in touch with a power not herself. Ironists who are inclined to philosophize see the choice between vocabularies as made neither within a neutral and universal meta-vocabulary not by an attempt to fight one's way past appearances to the real, but simply by playing the new off against the old.\"So imagine living life as an ironist as opposed to this other type of person we were just talking about. You'd live your day to day life not like Phyrro in ancient athens walking in front of cars because you're doubting whether or not they're actually there...you'd HAVE a sort of working theory, a final vocabulary that you use to function...the DIFFERENCE would be that you would have seen OTHER final vocabularies, seen their weaknesses, and you would realize that yours is probably EQUALLY as flawed as there's in some way. Because you don't have SPECIAL access to the truth...you don't have a diety backing your worldview...you don't have some neutral point outside of culture and history that you're doing your thinking from. You are JUST as fallible as they are and your conclusions rely on history and culture JUST as much as there's do. You would have continuing radical doubt about your relationship with reality. You'd ALSO realize...that any attempt by you to argue that your final vocabulary is superior to others...is a pointless exercise that is ACTUALLY just an example of that circular reasoning we talked about before...because you're arguing FOR a set of stories and narratives as being superior...but all the while you're USING that set of stories and narratives as the premise that you're starting your arguments from.This is why Rorty thinks that when it comes to our final vocaublaries...ARGUING in the traditional sense is not a very effective way of making any progress. Rorty says that an ironist always realizes \"that anything can be made to look good or bad by being re-described\". Because it's not like there is some SINGLE, argumentative standard out there...winning an argument in the times of Napolean is just different than winning an argument today...because the values of the people judging have changed, the historical circumstances have changed, the story about how the world fits together has changed...different arguments are more effective in different final vocabularies. So ARGUING is ALWAYS relying on your points fitting well into the final vocabulary of whoever it is you're talking to--- which is FAR from a guarantee...and the OTHER side of that is that you may find yourself CONSTANTLY arguing against a particular, COMMON final vocabulary that happens to dominate the culture you were born into.Better to instead LEAD by example through irony. When someone thinks they've lassoed the truth with their vocabulary...the far more effective method will ALWAYS be to do what Rorty calls: ironic disruption...which doesn't mean pull our your Richard Rorty handbook and argue them down point by point until they see the world the way you do...the goal is through one method or another, usually rhetorical devices...you try to allow this person to see on their own...the perspective from OUTSIDE their single worldview...the hope being that once they're in this place they will realize how limiting their basic way of viewing the world is because it COMPLETELY closes them off from new ways of connecting with people, ideas, and the world that is out there, once again the WORLD that is out there...not the TRUTH that is out there. To be in this place stepping outside of your worldview and seeing a COMPLETELY different way the world can be rationally justified...can be transformative. Should be said this process also benefits the ironist because they need AS MUCH experience with final vocabularies as they can get. They need to be able to spot them from a mile away.Rorty says in a passage that an ironist is \"never quite able to take themselves seriously\". Because they live their life acknowledging how much of their final vocabulary wasn't even a choice that THEY consciously made...and that at any point some of the issues that they believe in most strongly today... might tomorrow, change in a single conversation.This is a very different approach to your intellectual development, and a VERY different way of approaching conversations with people that disagree with you politically. This person would seem like an ALIEN in the current political landscape, but this is ultimately the TYPE of person that emerges in a Pluralistic landscape of ideas...rather than one that believes in a single, correct answer to every political question. See you may wonder why bother? Why even spend a SECOND of my life trying to talk to someone and show them how they're limiting themselves to a single answer? Let them do whatever it is they're gonna do. But Rorty would say that these people that truly believe they are reading books and getting past the world of appearances to the TRUE reality of things...this outdated, oversimplified attitude is responsible for SO MUCH of the CRUELTY that goes on in this world. Liberal society, in his eyes, has a constant obligation to remind ourselves of the ways that the current order of things might be hurting the people around us. Much more effective with a Pluralistic outlook.You know, there are relativists that will try to make an argument for people to stop fighting over their petty disagreements because ultimately everything is arbitrary...there are Rationalists that will say that everyone should stop fighting because well I've come up with the RIGHT ANSWER, no more work to be done! The way that Richard Rorty walks the line of nature and culture is partially through his beautiful use of Pragmatism. Rorty wouldn't say you should care less. He wouldn't say you should care more. What he would say I think is that the substance of what we care about...LIES in solidarity amongst fellow human beings. That solidarity is what keeps us in line, not a cosmic law. That solidarity is what determines our values, not some philosopher in a tower. To understand the historical and cultural environment that you live in is only the FIRST STEP towards understanding the solidarity that holds society together. He said it well when describing his book here in one of the most famous passages from his work:\"the fundamental premise of this book is that a belief can still regulate action, can still be worth dying for among people who are quite aware that this belief is caused by nothing more than contingent historical circumstances\"Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n"

        "ep": "Episode #143",
        "title": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas - The Public Sphere",
        "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #143 on Jurgen Habermas. Check out the episode page HERE.So for a long, long time the Enlightenment has been the whipping child paying for all the mistakes and all the transgressions of philosophers and leaders alike...and this child has taken a LOT of ABUSE over the years! First we had the counter-Enlightenment, then we had the Existentialists, then we had the beginning of the 20th century, then we had the Postmodernists...but for ALL these thinkers and ALL the different ways they thought the Enlightenment had produced practically EVERY problem we faced as a species...there were JUST as many IF NOT MORE thinkers that came back at them with a very nuanced philosophical argument that's been used since the BEGINNING OF TIME, and the argument was this: Yeah...but still.Yeah, turns out in retrospect we aren't using rationality to arrive at the intrinsic structure of the Universe...but still...who really wants to throw out the entirety of what the Enlightenment has produced in the mean time? Do you really want to throw out all of the technical understanding of the universe that science has produced? Do you really want to throw out all the economic progress? Do you want to just sit here vacationing in France deconstructing grand narratives for the rest of our lives? The thinker we're going to be talking about today: Jurgen Habermas...said no.Habermas thought sure...the Enlightenment HAD some problems. And yes, maybe we're not arriving at the capital T truth about anything. But maybe a better plan would be for us to take a closer look at the project of the Enlightenment, figure out what went wrong...and then try to re-work and re-imagine it so that we can PRESERVE all of the things that were so GREAT about it. Habermas called the problems produced by the Enlightenment the \"pathologies of modernity\"...and he thought these pathologies were not a sign that the project of modernity was a total failure...he thought they were evidence that the project was incomplete. Reason...had been looked at in such a narrow and uncharitable way by the critics of modernity that it was never given a chance to realize it's full potential...which by the end of the episode we will understand, could be the emancipation of the entire human species.So let's get started anyone looking to defend the Enlightenment PROBABLY has to begin by addressing some of the most notable works criticizing the Enlightenment..and one of the most SCATHING investigations into what went wrong we talked about all the way back in our series on the Frankfurt School...one of the most famous books in the history of philosophy: The Dialectic of Enlightenment by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer.Should be said Habermas is ALSO a member of the Frankfurt School, ALBEIT the newly formed Frankfurt School back in Germany after the war..and while many of his ideas overlap with OTHER thinkers in the Frankfurt School... he nonetheless HAS to take this early 20th century book to task to be able to move forward adequately with HIS work.Like we talked about last episode Adorno and Horkheimer thought that the project of the Enlightenment was destined to consume itself from the beginning, because by using reason to question the foundationalism of religion...there would be an immediate need for reason to in turn question ITSELF as a foundation, at which point we'd HAVE no clear foundations for our values and we'd open up the floodgates of totalitarianism...among many other things they thought might go wrong. Check out the series on the Frankfurt School if you want to hear more, but right now we have to move on with THIS episode. To skip ahead, they believed one of the major problems that faced modernity was that the project of the Enlightenment put FAR TOO MUCH faith in reason. But Habermas is going to say that Adorno and Horkheimer made a huge mistake. They defined reason in a very narrow way that only included two TYPES of reason and ignored other important examples of how reason presents itself in human life.Reason during the Enlightenment was two things to Adorno and Horkheimer, one had to do with making reasonable STATEMENTS about the world...reason on one hand was the unbiased measuring tool that can supposedly get us to the truth about the universe...which...hopefully by THIS point on the show we've talked about enough. But number two had to do with determining which human ACTIONS were reasonable...THIS type of reason was known as Instrumental Reason, or put another way...the type of reason that helps us rationally progress from a starting point...to a conclusion. This is the type of reason that is instrumental...when it comes to providing the rational means...that can get us to certain ENDS we want to achieve. Means to an end...keep that in mind because it's going to be important...but first let's give some examples of why this type of reason is a PROBLEM for Adorno and Horkheimer and before them the sociologist Max Weber.Think of how this type of reason impacts many of these Enlightenment thinkers that spend their lives trying to create ELABORATE systems that explained the way the universe is. How easy would it be...to come up with a conclusion for how you think reality is...and then use rational analysis to prove, step by step, that YOUR conclusion is correct. The very fact that so many thinkers seemingly proved things that were mutually exclusive...just goes to show WHY this could be a problem...now to show how this instrumental reason can be downright DANGEROUS...let's consider a more extreme, everyday example.Let's say I have some CRAZY goal I want to achieve. Let's say I want to stab myself in the eye with a fork...then I want to run outside and take out a pack of predatory buffalo in my front yard and THEN I'm going to take an entire pallet of Aquanet and spray it into the sky so that it rips a hole in the ozone layer, now...ridiculous goal without a doubt...but nonetheless there are completely rational steps we could plan out that would provide us the means to get closer and closer to this END we're trying to achieve. First I go into the kitchen, open the drawer, grab a fork. Then I go out into the front yard and start tackling buffalos one by one...the DANGER of instrumental reason is that it is completely possible to mistake a process...that is ENTIRELY RATIONAL for it being something humanity should EVER want to implement.See instrumental reason can only get us from point A to point B...but who out there gets to decide what point B should consist of? Left in the hands of the Enlightenment... many critics believed it led to the chaos of the 20th century. So this raises the question, how do we ever ensure that the ENDS we're trying to achieve never become co-opted, as Habermas feared, by a single thinker or group that happens to captivate a particular culture with a compelling argument during their time? History has shown us this is very possible...and it should be said in THIS sense the postmodernists feared a very real threat that was looming out there. The defensive strategy of some was to deconstruct and fragment these grand narratives that SPOKE about having conclusions we should be aiming for...the goal being to show that human knowledge is ALWAYS from a particular, individual perspective...not from some privileged position.So right now we should pause and understand that THIS is the climate that Habermas finds himself doing his work in. He wants to on one hand...acknowledge the fact that knowledge ALWAYS NEEDS to go through the filter of an individual, human perspective...but he thinks it's possible...through inter-subjectivity...through ALL of these individual human perspectives coming together...maybe it's possible for us to arrive at useful information ABOUT reality...that doesn't RELY on any one, single person's perspective. This is why near the end of the 20th century there is a resurgence in the philosophical approach of Pragmatism. Habermas being one of the greats.See it's from this Pragmatic perspective that Habermas sees where Adorno and Horkheimer went wrong. Reason is NOT JUST instrumental and strategic reason...one of the biggest ways reason presented itself in the world that changed the game ALL THE WAY BACK in the Enlightenment...was through the process of what he calls: Communicative Rationality . Let me explain what he means by that.See like many philosophers throughout the 20th century Habermas was interested in linguistic analysis...but UNLIKE many philosophers Habermas developed a healthy obsession with the specific topic of communication. Language MAY shape our reality to a certain degree...but HOW WE communicate that language has a considerable effect as well. Signs and symbols may be the raw building materials, but the way they're communicated is the construction team that puts the building together.So while on this journey where he's fascinated by how people communicate with each other Habermas realizes a few things. Whenever someone successfully communicates ANYTHING to another person... and that person understands what was said...that communication will NEED to have possessed four VERY important qualities. One, it needs to be intelligible. Needs to use actual words, needs to follow the rules of grammar, etc. Two, both people must accept beforehand that whatever they're talking about is a legitimate conversation to have at all. Three, there has to be an understanding that both people BELIEVE whatever it is that they're saying, not just trying to manipulate each other. And four, whatever REASONING is used in the conversation needs to correspond with certain values or norms that both people agree upon and understand.Now, the exciting philosophical point that all FOUR of these criteria are basically saying here is that language is not this disinterested set of building blocks where we just describe raw, states of affairs. I'm going to deliver you the news in an unbiased way! I'm going to tell you what I think about your uncle Lou in an unbiased way. To communicate ANYTHING and for the OTHER PERSON to understand it...we have to embed our speech in normative constraints. The way that we view the world morally or otherwise HAS to be present in any successful communication we have with someone else.Now, some of you out there might be saying, okay...Habermas. That's all well and good...I love learning about language...but what does ANY of this have to do with political philosophy or rescuing reason from all those evil Postmodernists? Habermas is going to say that Instrumental Reason...that means to an end that we talked about...is not the only way that reason manifests in the world that's capable of governing human actions. There is ANOTHER type of reason... grounded in our communication with other human beings... that can not only inform our political strategy, but can also provide a justification for liberal democracy that doesn't rely on a God or appeal to anything supposedly written into the universe.In fact, from the unique vantage point of being BOTH a sociologist AND a Pragmatic philosopher Habermas talks about how different TYPES of reason actually MIRROR the different methods of coordinating human action...hence the connection to political philosophy. Let me give you a few examples.So one way of governing human action is to give people a set of rules or norms to live by. This is just one way, human beings, could figure out what to do next. This could be actual rules posted on a wall...this could be moral standards...this could even just be societal norms that are unspoken...for example you don't just walk into the bank and cut in front of everybody in line...unless if you're that one guy in crocs that actually wears a straw hat to the bank that I go to. But we don't talk about that guy...point is you can govern human action pretty effectively by holding people to a code of conduct. Now, COMPARE this...to one TYPE of rationality that follows a set of pre-ordained rules. Think of syllogisms in formal logic...All cats are mean. Snowball is a cat. Therefore, Snowball is mean...you can have a string of propositions just as you can have a string of human actions and if any one of those propositions doesn't follow the necessary rules, the entire string becomes invalid. This way of reason presenting in the world MIRRORS a particular method of governing human action.Let's talk about the one Adorno and Horkheimer were so concerned with: Instrumental Reason. The same way we can decide on a conclusion we'd like to rationally justify...and then come up with a series of actions that rationally move us closer and closer to that end...GROUP human action can ALSO be mediated by turning PEOPLE into a means to an end. We see this kind of thing in the military, or a company, or a sports team...the Army, for example, has a mission that it needs to carry out. A final goal, or an end...and each and every soldier down to the lowest rank plays a small but necessary role in accomplishing that greater overall mission. The soldiers in this case BECOME a means to an end. We can govern human action...in other words...by turning individuals into a means that is working towards some END that we've decided is worth pursuing.Well Habermas is going to say a third way that human action can be coordinated and a third way that reason presents itself in human life...the type of reason Adorno and Horkheimer mistakenly left OUT and the type of reason grounded in our communication...is what he calls Communicative Rationality. Simply put...there is ANOTHER way that human beings can coordinate what they should do moving forward...and that is by coming together and having genuine, intelligible conversations starting from a premise of similar values...in other words, following those four criteria for proper communication we talked about before...people get together, communicate effectively, and rationally come to a collective agreement about how they should move forward.So again this is not holding people to a set of rules or norms, this is NOT making people a means to an end...Communicative Rationality is a particular way of communicating that carries with it the express intent of delivering your perspective, hearing the perspectives of other people, and ultimately coming to an agreement about things. Now, Habermas would INSTANTLY want to mark a contrast between this Communicative Rationality and Strategic Rationality. Because a very important piece of these conversations where everyone is speaking their piece, debating, trying to come to an agreement is that everyone speaking actually, genuinely believes in whatever case it is that they're trying to make. That is the ESSENCE of Communicative Rationality...but what happens when someone DOESN'T really believe in what they're saying? Maybe they're just arguing a particular position because they BENEFIT from people HOLDING that position. Maybe they're just trolling. These are examples of what Habermas calls Strategic Rationality... and the best example of this is probably a classic salesman.Picture someone at one of those kiosks at the mall trying to sell you a smartphone case. There's a sense in which when you're talking to that person... the entire interaction is clouded by the fact... that it's not really a genuine conversation that you're having. Does this person REALLY care this much about phones being protected? Do they REALLY care about your own personal level of phone safety? No, there's a sense in which everything that they say can be taken with a grain of salt...there's a sense in which everything they say to you about how great their phone cases are is driven by the fact that they're going to get paid a commission if they sell you one.Having a conversation with this person is uncomfortable and if you were the kind of person genuinely trying to develop your understanding of the world of phone cases...this would DEFINITELY not be the person you'd want to talk to. Well imagine this same kind of interaction speaking to someone about politics... where they have a similar incentive to sell you a particular idea. More on that in a second, but I want to plant a flag in the ground here and mark this as a BIG reason why it is EXTREMELY important... for everyone to genuinely believe in what it is they're debating when engaging in Communicative Rationality within a group.Because remember...embedded into our communication is a common set of premises and a common set of values for the people who are having the conversation. Now couple this with the fact that Habermas is a huge fan of Liberal Democracy and the Enlightenment's attempt to try to ground its legitimacy in something GREATER than just pure relativism...and you can start to see the direction Habermas is going here. Communicative Rationality is essentially...democracy. People come together, they have conversations with each other about the best course of action and then they decide which way to go moving forward.But let's consider something important about democracy for a second. Democracy is just a word...its a word that denotes a particular political strategy that we're all very familiar with. And while we should USE the word democracy so that we have something specific to reference and while the political strategy is NO DOUBT the most neatly packaged VERSION of what it is we're talking about here...we should NEVER forget... that the PROCESS that underlies the system of democracy has applications FAR BEYOND the realm of politics. To Habermas, Communicative Rationality IS that process, and people use it all the time. They use it to have conversations trying to figure out which political candidate to choose. They use it when deciding where their group of friends should meet for dinner. They use it at their church to decide where the funds should be allocated. The process of two or more people coming together, telling each other about their own experiences, trading insights, and then using all the information at their disposal to try to come to an agreement about how to move forward...trading recipes is included in THAT process...how much butter to put in your chocolate chip cookies! The point is: this is a PROCESS that human beings generally engage in even if it's purest expression is in the realm of politics in something we call democracy...and to Habermas as modernity has progressed over the years...gradual changes in people's lives have made participating in this process progressively rare. There is less and less participation, BY CITIZENS, in one of the greatest things Habermas thinks the Enlightenment EVER produced to improve the lives of individuals...something he calls: The Public Sphere.Now, to understand WHY he thinks this is happening we have to understand what the public sphere is and how it even came into existence in the first place. Let's start with a bit of historical context.Say you were an average citizen living in pre-Enlightenment France, which would of course be prior to the French Revolution. That would place you right in the middle of the feudal system organized by the three estates of government. First estate was the church...second estate was the nobility and the third estate was the peasantry. The peasantry...meaning EVERYBODY ELSE. When there's political turmoil...or there is a serious situation that needs to be handled by government...the deliberation ABOUT that decision...the burden of choosing which direction to go, FALLS on the shoulders of the king or queen...MAYBE there's consultation between the first TWO estates...maybe the church is considered in the decision making but one thing is for sure: the peasantry was NOT part of the political process at all. France would, for example, go to war with Spain...and throughout the entire process of deciding whether or not to GO to war the peasantry would never even be asked for an opinion.So when it comes to being a politically informed member of your society up on current events...when you're a peasant in the middle ages, not only can you probably not read, but even if you could read you probably speak a language DIFFERENT than the information is being written in at the time. When you're having conversations with friends...you're not having a political debate...you're talking about famine and harvests and events happening in your local community and much of the time probably your relationship with the church.But then the Enlightenment comes along. Governments are restructured. Economies are restructured. But maybe the BIGGEST change when it comes to political involvement is that mass print is becoming more common. There is a rapid rise of what we now know as the bourgeoisie, or the middle class...not ONLY in terms of spending power but ALSO in terms of formulating their own set of values and political attitude.So these changes at the beginning of the Enlightenment allow for an entirely NEW kind of space to emerge, the classic coffee houses or salons of early Enlightenment France. For the first time in the history of the world a person could go down to one of these communal gathering places, pick up a mass printed journal that they were capable of reading, READ about what the king or queen was doing, the political goings on of the day...and then DISCUSS and DEBATE what was going on with their fellow citizens. These gathering places became the forum where the political VOICE of the middle class could finally be developed...and the EXISTENCE of these forums led to MASSIVE changes when it comes to how the governments of the future had to interact with the public. These public forums of discussion and the greater political VOICE that surrounded them became known to Habermas as the public sphere.Now, the public sphere is based in the process of communicative rationality. This is a democracy of ideas. The process of coming together, giving your own individual experiences you've had in life and trying to discuss towards arriving at an agreement was just PART of it. But as modernity has gone on, Habermas says, people have been engaging in the public sphere less and less. More generally, with the progression of technology, people have been engaging in communicative rationality less frequently...they're having fewer of these conversations with each other where they learn about the world around them through other human beings.But WHY is this happening? Habermas thinks this trajectory began at the beginning of the Enlightenment. Prior to the Enlightenment major elements of society were largely determined by inherited tradition...we structured things like the economy or the government to resemble the way that things had worked for us before. But post-Enlightenment, once we've thrown OUT these classical traditions and are instead trying to build these systems from scratch...what happens is EACH ONE of these systems has to rebuild itself and come up with its own self reinforcing rationality that keeps it alive and moves it forward. When it comes to the economy and the government in particular...Habermas thinks what emerged at their base was a very OBVIOUS form of Instrumental Rationality. Means to an end thinking.Makes total sense too...the government has certain ends it needs to accomplish for the maintenance of society. The economy...has certain benchmarks it needs to meet...PROFIT is almost always an end worth going for. Habermas thinks what has happened as the years have gone on is that the lines between the economy and the government have blurred beyond recognition. The two have fused together into a sort of super system...he just calls it \"the system\"...but the point is the two have combined into a massive, powerful means to an end machine.We live our lives as modern people immersed in two competing worlds, to Habermas. See certain aspects of our lives are determined for us...we are given a socio-economic role to play within society by this economic/governmental system that exists...whatever person we want to be HAS to take into consideration those parameters handed down to us. But on the other hand there are MANY aspects of who we are that are determined by what he calls the \"lifeworld\"...or the piece of our lives that resembles the public sphere and communicative rationality...this is the portion of our lives where we exchange experiences and have discussions...this is where citizens get together, talk to each other and DECIDE on the path moving forward, rather than act like little soldiers for the economic governmental system that TELLS them how to behave as a means to make sure we can bring about certain ends.Now, what has ALSO happened in modernity that has led to the relationship between the lifeworld and the system being even more complicated...is that the nature of media has drastically changed. By and large anymore people are not reading journals and newspapers to get their understanding of what's going on in the world...and if they are the ownership and agenda of those newspapers and journals has completely transformed.Remember our salesman at the kiosk in the mall trying to sell you a smartphone case? How it feels like it's not even an authentic conversation because they're constantly trying to SELL you something and you can leave the conversation feeling a little bit dirty. Well Habermas thinks the nature of media has changed into more something that's looking to SELL you a candidate than to report the news. To SELL you a way to be, a system of values to believe in...rather than you participating in communicative rationality with your fellow human beings and arriving at one.Now you might respond to that with: well, when you get around the dinner table and start talking about values...THOSE people are just trying to SELL you THEIR ideas as well! But this is why it's so important...that to even PARTICIPATE in communicative rationality you need to genuinely believe in whatever it is you're arguing for. Because of COURSE...Habermas thinks MOST OF THE TIME...people within these conversations are going to disagree and misunderstand each other and both sides are going to try to convince the other one of why they're right...but the relationship BETWEEN these two parties is going to be between two REAL human beings having a conversation about something they both believe in...and NOT between a salesman and a customer.When transnational corporations with very specific ends they're trying to achieve OWN major media outlets. When there is so much power in controlling people's values...Habermas thinks the economic/governmental system COLONIZES the lifeworld. Where we used to sit around the dinner table and have discussions to determine our thoughts about the world...we now turn on a screen and are SOLD ways to think about things. The further we got from the origins of the public sphere in those coffee houses back in France ...the further we got away from communicative rationality. We got so far away from it we could barely SEE it anymore...to the point where brilliant thinkers like Adorno and Horkheimer wrote an entire book about rationality and didn't even consider its existence!But for any chains we were supposedly wrapped in by the Enlightenment, Habermas thought the key to get us out of them was built into the Enlightenment all along. We just lost sight of it. The emancipatory potential of reason...reason's ability to direct us AWAY from treating people as a means to an end...the type of reason GROUNDED in communication...GROUNDED in the pursuit of genuinely trying to understand the other person's perspective and then working towards agreement...the type of reason that can allow us to make our decisions about things not by buying into an endless sales pitch, but by talking to our fellow citizens in the lifeworld comparing our individual perspecitives...True democracy, to Habermas, is when the lifeworld controls the system. Not the system controlling the lifeworld.Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\n"

        "ep": "Episode #144",
        "title": "Max Weber - Iron Cage",
        "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #144 on Max Weber. Check out the episode page HERESo when the enlightenment began the hope was that through the process of scientific rationality... we would be gradually, but steadily moving forward towards several very important goals...freedom on a level never before witnessed by human beings...the promise of societies with levels of EQUALITY never before witnessed...through the ongoing process of using science to refine the systems of thought that surrounded us...the Enlightenment promised higher levels of efficiency, more sophisticated levels of technology...what the Enlightenment sold to people... was the expectation that every day that a human being lived henceforth would be a day lived in the direction of progress...constantly moving towards a better world.  Now one thing that is ABSOLUTELY clear is that when it comes to delivering on a lot of these promises...credit where credit's due...the Enlightenment did what it set out to do and it did it well. Not many people question the level of impact the Enlightenment had...because ...quite frankly if it produced little to no results not only would there not be as many critics as there are, but there'd be no reason to delineate between pre-modern and modern if we weren't talking about two very distinct eras. Make no mistake: the Enlightenment DELIVERED like it was an essential worker.  Science was all the rage in the early Enlightenment...and when people saw the kind of results it was getting there was a feeling by some that maybe it would be a good idea...to apply this new kind of scientific rationality...to EVERYTHING. Scientific rationality leads to efficiency and accuracy, we KNOW this...why not HAVE a scientific approach to the government...a scientific approach to the economy...a scientific understanding of human cognition...why not have, a scientific understanding of the historical forces that drive society...or a scientific understanding of how people interact with each other within a society. What we're talking about here is a movement at the end of the 19th century that will eventually become known as the birth...of the social sciences. One of them being sociology and one of the founding members of it was the guy we're going to be talking about today: Max Weber. Now it should be said right off the bat that this focus on hyper-efficiency when it comes to our social institutions has not always been the way that we do things. For example, in the pre-modern world generally speaking they did the best they COULD when it came to efficiency...but a more primary concern of theirs was to put together a society that endured. What combination of things has worked in the past? This is why they were so adamant about tradition.  Max Weber would say these pre-modern societies were like little art projects...they were a bunch of different parts cobbled together into something that worked...and this entire process of applying scientific rationality to every piece of the world to make it the most efficient...BREAKS these societies down into their component parts, in other words...scientific rationality is not looking at society as a WHOLE and trying to make it more efficient...government has it's own rationality and set of premises it's beholden to, the economy was the same, the arts had it's own goals, all in an attempt to make each of these respective fields and many others...AS, efficient as possible. Now...more generally...Weber saw the whole project... of trying to use scientific rationality to make everything as efficient as possible, to know EVERYTHING about the natural world, to be able to offer TOTAL freedom and equality for every person in the world...this was ultimately humanity's attempt at what he called a sort of \"world mastery\". We want to master...the world.  Now, Weber might say...you hear the term world mastery...doesn't really sound too bad! I mean who WOULDN'T want to live in a world where we've mastered it. Who WOULDN'T want to live in a world where every day that passes is civilization progressing further and further into a level of existence no human being has ever experienced before? Then again...he would say...think of the WEIGHT that you live under...that also NO HUMAN BEING has ever experienced...think of the weight of feeling like every day that you live needs to be a step forward. This is NOT the way most societies throughout history have felt.  That thing that I did right there...where no matter how good something sounds at first there may be unintended side effects that necessarily go along with it...that's going to be common in this episode...because it's a hallmark of Weber's work. See being a sociologist at the end of the 19th century...one of his primary goals is going to be looking at the lives of the people of modernity...and he's going to consider no matter how good it sounds... when you talk about what the enlightenment has produced...technology, efficiency, equality, knowledge and freedom...how has MASTERING THE WORLD in these areas created NEW challenges for people that have to live in the present era.  So I want to start with equality because it's obviously an issue that's on everyone's minds lately. But before we get started there are a couple very important disclaimers I want to make, that are relevant for the entire episode but particularly relevant for the subject of equality just because of all that's going on in the world. First of all....when Max Weber says something like we have progressed since the Enlightenment when it comes to the subject of equality...he is by no means saying that we have reached some sort of END POINT in that area. This actually applies to many things that the project of the Enlightenment has helped bring about. Take knowledge for instance: we have undeniably made progress when it comes to our scientific understanding of the universe...but there is obviously still an enormous amount of work that needs to be done in that area. Take technological progress: we have definitely come a long way since the days of the early Enlightenment when it comes to the technology we have at our disposal...but CLEARLY we are not at some sort of endpoint...clearly there is always more progress we can make in that area if we dedicate resources to doing it. Well, same thing with equality. When you compare the life of the average person living in medieval Europe with the life of the average person living during Weber's time...still a lot of work that needs to be done of course, but we have been generally moving in the right direction. So if over the course of the episode you hear Max Weber say things that sound critical of the idea of equality...please understantd that he's not making a case against the idea that we should be making our societies more equal...he's ultimately weighing the pros and cons of pre-modern approaches to society to modern ones. That as we continue marching forward towards making our societies as equal as we possibly can FOR EVERYONE in society...there will undeniably be great things that come from it...but as a sociologist he wants to also point out the unique challenges the people of modernity are going to have to figure out how to deal with along the way, as we inevitably move closer and closer to that goal.  So what are some new things the people of modernity are going to have to experience as a result of us making equality one of our major priorities?  Well Max Weber would say that with increased levels of equality within our social institutions...the more TRULY equal everyone is, the closer we get to that ultimate goal we will always have to deal with a higher level of dehumanization and increased levels of bureaucracy. The classic example of this that you can find in tons of essays on Weber's work is to think of how things work at the department of licensing or the DMV. What is the first thing you do when you walk into the DMV? You take a number and sit down until your number is called. Outside the doors of the DMV you are an individual person, you have friends, family, social status, values...inside the doors of the DMV...you become a number.  Now let's say the reason you went to the DMV that day was because of some sort of emergency situation. Let's say your mom was sick and needs someone to take care of her, but she lives upstate, your license is expired, so you have to get it reinstated so that you can drive up there and take care of her. Now let's say you go up to the counter and the person behind the counter tells you that there's a 48 hour waiting period for them to be able to renew your license.  There are a serious number of people out there...that would lament the fact that the DMV wouldn't look at their individual situation...and make an exception for them. Maybe put their form at the top of the pile...maybe just run in the back real quick and fix my license right now while I'm here. Why can't this person behind the counter just treat me like a human being. Why can't they smile and say \"how ya doin? what brings you into the DMV on this fine day? oh, I'm so sorry to hear about your mother!\" Why can't this person take things on a case by case basis? Why must I be a number instead of a name? Max Weber would say, so in other words what you want is a privileged status? Preferential treatment over everyone else? Some people are more charismatic or good looking than other people. What if the person behind the counter just likes people with blue eyes more than people with brown eyes? What would HAPPEN at that point is anyone born with brown eyes... would instantly be part of some under-privileged class that doesn't get THEIR form put at the top of the pile for their entire lives... because of something they were born with that was COMPLETELY out of their control. How is THAT equal? Weber would say that as our imperative towards greater levels of equality progresses...SO TO must the citizens of modernity learn to deal with being just a fellow number and not a special human being. Once again these great things that we want to implement in our societies often come with a price. The question is CAN people THINK of themselves a little less, pay that price, and be consistent in our values as citizens rather than individuals.   Nevertheless this was a NEW THING that the people of modernity had to deal with that the people of pre-modernity never had to consider. Take ANOTHER example of something the Enlightenment has produced: greater levels of freedom for the average citizen. Now once again...you'd be hard pressed to find ANYONE...living in today's world that would have a problem with trying to progressively find better and better ways to make people as free as is prudent. But Weber would say consider the potential downsides to having this societal imperative of freedom.  See, if you were living in a pre-modern society...say you're a peasant in the middle ages. From the moment you are born...you may know a LOT OF THINGS about what you're going to be for the rest of your life. You may know that you're never going to hold political office...you're never going start a business...fact is you may know you are going to be in that village for the rest of your life working the land...adhering to the will of a God whose decree you were born into rather than chose. You may know pretty much who your significant other is going to be...you may know the answer to whether you're gonna have kids...but for all this lack of freedom that may sound HORRIBLE to people living in modernity...Weber would say IN this position... you would also AT LEAST be able to know...who, you, are.  Your identity, at the very least, would not ever be something that ever caused you too much stress. Now, smash cut to modernity. How many people have you met that agonize for YEARS trying to figure out the answers to these enormously complex life questions? See, when we seek to guarantee as much freedom as possible to our fellow citizens...there are undeniably many great things that are gonna come out of that. But the flip side to being able to go anywhere, be anything, do anything...is that now it is YOUR exclusive responsibility to choose from the BILLIONS of different decisions at your disposal...and also to constantly worry about whether or not you made the right decision. Once again...let's keep going on our journey...let's make people as free as we possibly can in our societies...but Weber's saying this is something the people of modernity are going to HAVE to learn to deal with along the way.  Let's look at another example: technological progress. Again, most people, would see increased levels of technology as a good thing because of all the different things it allows us to do, not to mention the lives it allows us to save. But Weber would say consider the fact that as technology progresses, it produces a sense of alienation when it comes to our connection to the world around us. Here's what he means: the nature of technology is that the current state of technology always produces the next GENERATION of technology. We then have better technology that is then used to produce the NEXT generation. The SPEED of technological progress increases as the level of sophistication increases in the technology that builds it. You could compare this...to a snowball rolling down hill constantly picking up speed and getting larger and larger.  Now consider what a new technology DOES when it displaces an old technology. The older piece of technology is rendered obsolete...which in turn means that pieces of our LIVES are then rendered obsolete. Let me give you an example.  Say you're a computer programmer. Now imagine you went to school for YEARS to learn how to code using a particular coding language. Now imagine you graduate, get a job, and two years later a brand NEW coding language becomes the standard, and it is clear to everyone including you... that this language is just clearly better than the one you are currently using...it can do things, more efficiently than that old language could ever even aspire to. Now on the surface this is just the world getting an upgrade...technology is progressing and making people's lives easier. But think about it from the perspective of the programmer. This person spent YEARS of their life essentially writing digital poetry in this special language that they speak. They expressed themselves with it. They took things that were at one point just pictures in their minds and CREATED it in reality, with this language. Whatever connection they had to the real world that we made possible by that language, is gone now, in other words, they have one less thing to feel connected to in the world. But the thing is this isn't just the case with computer languages...there are countless examples of this.  Picture not being able to watch old home movies because nobody sells VCRs anymore. Picture going back to your childhood home to see the setting where you grew up...only to find it was replaced by high rise condominiums...or some NEW house with FAR BETTER structural integrity because construction methods have improved DRASTICALLY since you were a kid.  What we love about technology is that it subverts the current world as it is...but the flip side to that is that often times it is SUBVERTING things that have meaning to us...and this whole process is only speeding up. And as the rate of change becomes faster and faster...it becomes next to impossible for anything to endure long enough in the world for us to feel any sentimental value. The world starts to change so fast... that we can't even locate pieces of ourselves within it. This is another thing the people of modernity will have to learn to deal with.  Let's talk about one more thing the Enlightenment promised and ABSOLUTELY delivered on: increased levels of efficiency. The idea was that we could take scientific rationality and in the same way we applied it to the task of trying to understand the universe better...we could apply it to things like agriculture, the economy, government, the farming of animals, manufacturing of consumer goods, there was a sense in which there wasn't any process that couldn't be made more efficient compared to how it was done in the pre-modern world if only we look at it scientifically and trust the numbers and data.  Now keep in mind if you were living in the PRE-MODERN world, these things are usually carried out by yielding to tradition. Good portion of the time there are rituals and ceremonies that people have come up with over the years that not only commemorate the whole process but also allow for human beings to feel a sense of connection to these aspects of maintaining their society. But in the MODERN world, Weber would say, where making things as efficient as possible has become the chief priority, these traditions, ceremonies and rituals start to become just unnecessary inefficiencies. To make things as efficient as possible often times we have to get rid of any sort of pesky human feelings that get in the way so that the numbers can look as good as possible.  Should be said this DOESN'T just have to do with needing to toss out all our old traditions that formerly gave us a sense of connection to the world...this same sacrifice of humanity for numbers exists in the world of modern corporate accounting as well. The employees of a medium to large sized company become numbers on a page, dollars in vs dollars out. Modern accounting gives our businesses an unprecedented level of efficiency, but again Weber would say it does so with a certain level of sacrifice.  Now what do all these sacrifices we've been talking about add up to? Weber would say that every one of these things we've been talking about is an example of humanity trying to apply what he calls \"rationalization\" to the component parts of a society all in an attempt for eventually achieving world mastery. Science and rationalization is undeniably great at doing all these things that we're asking it to do. The question that plagues the people of modernity is when every day NEEDS to be a day moving towards PROGRESS, where NO CIVILIZATION HAS EVER GONE BEFORE!...when you try to make everything as RATIONAL and EFFICIENT as you possibly can...do we end up creating societies where people work at an EXTREMELY efficient workplace, have a SWEET iphone 16x plus max plus, they have a BILLION options at their disposal in terms of what they can be...they know more about the universe than any other human being that's ever lived before...do we create societies where people have all these things...but feel utterly disconnected and completely empty inside?  Weber says that to live in modernity is like living inside of an iron cage. He describes the people of modernity in one of his most famous quotes ever: We are \"specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilization never before achieved.\" See at a certain level we're fooling ourselves, to Weber. We THINK we've achieved this level of civilization that is so advanced because we've learned to understand the external world around us and make a super efficient profit and loss sheet. But often times when you have this progressively, enormous understanding of the natural world around you...when you aim for world mastery...the only thing it REALLY serves to do for the average person is \"demystify\" the world, as he says. People in former societies have been capable of looking at the universe around them and reveling in the wondrous nature of it, but rationalization, as a process, the longer we make it one of our chief priorities...removes the mystery out of human life. Which is, again, on one hand the exact reason we LOVE it, we're TRYING to do this...but on the other hand it progressively disenchants the universe that we live in for people. Once again, for Weber...there's pros and cons to every strategy and we would do well to consider BOTH sides of things before we ever decide to implement something new.  Now, it's with THIS understanding of the work of Max Weber that I think it's important to pivot and begin talking about another thinker from around this time...Henri Bergson. Simply put, just to pick one of many entry points into the upcoming series we will be doing on him, simply put, Bergson thought that we as human beings try WAY too hard to relate to everything in the universe...spatially. When we look at the universe around us and we're trying to understand it better...we almost always begin by asking questions like...what are the spatial PROPERTIES of this thing? What are the three spatial dimensions that define this thing...what is it's length, width, or height. What spatially definable material is this thing made out of? What's the volume of this thing? What's the mass? What's the relationship between these two things that we HAVE these spatial definitions of, how does they spatially interact?  But all this spatial bookkeeping eventually only leads us down the road of thinking that to FURTHER understand these things we need to break things up into their component parts, in other words, understanding things deeper means breaking SPACE down into smaller pieces for us to examine more closely.  But Bergson's gonna say that there is no reason to assume... that SPATIAL considerations are necessarily the way that the universe should be broken up and understood. In fact, he thought all this talk about SPACE greatly shades the way that we see EVERYTHING about the universe around us. Famous example of this, that we'll talk about briefly now just to introduce the scope of his work but we'll of course talk about it far more in depth in the coming series, famous example is how he viewed the concept of time.  Now how do we typically view this concept of time in a scientific world obsessed with measurements and defining everything spatially? Well we break down time into tiny increments, a seemingly infinite succession of present moments. Seconds, minutes and hours. We love this way of looking at time...because it allows us to continue using the same methods we use to try to understand everything else we look at in the universe...we can measure time, we can rely on it's consistency maybe even come up with an equation that can predict it, we can think about time in terms of visual units all stacked up next to each other neatly into the horizon. But Bergson would say this isn't how time works. Time...is a process. Much like when you're in the movie theater and you're watching a movie...you don't experience what is on the screen as tens of thousands of little snapshots being run through a projector behind you...the story is just unfolding... into the future. When you think of what it is you're experiencing when you're watching a movie...there's a sense in which trying to break it down into a bunch of different present moments all lined up misses out on something CRUCIAL about our human experience of it. The same way it might be if a scientist or a mathematician tried to, for example, measure levels of sadness in people.  Say two people go into a lab and they're in a competition with each other to find out WHO is more sad between the two of them. They both say they're REALLY sad. They both rate their sadness 10/10. We can ask them questions and do brain scans all day long, but how can we EVER really, scientifically quantify if THIS person is more sad or THAT person? What measuring stick can we use to get to the bottom of how much suffering they FEEL in their internal, subjective human experience? More than that...could we ever REALLY pin down a persons level of sadness just by measuring it, as though it works that way, as though I experience life through this static level of sadness that doesn't change, or are these things more like processes...waves that are constantly unfolding into the future in unknown directions.  See as important as understanding the external world is...this internal world JUST AS MUCH a domain for philosophy to explore. These questions are JUST as much a part of existence as the volume and weight of limestone. Bergson thinks when you look at things like time, or internal experience, or thousands of other things we'll talk about in the upcoming series...when you look at these things you start to understand that the fundamental building blocks of the universe may be processes...rather than anything static and easily measurable.  The best metaphor I've seen used to describe this is a common one and it goes like this. Picture you're out in the desert and you come across a giant sand dune on a fairly windy day. Now imagine THAT SAND DUNE is the universe, and you represent humanity's attempt so far to try to understand it. Now picture you try to measure it, you try to weigh it, you pull out your measuring tape and get started...and there's a sense in which by the time you've even gotten done taking the first measurement...that sand dune is a different thing than when you began. Halfway through that sand dune has transformed into a COMPLETELY different thing. You could be out in that desert for a BILLION YEARS trying your hardest to get the measurements and pin down what exactly that sand dune is and STILL fail, through no fault of your own. That sand dune is a process, not a static thing that can ever be measured. This idea would form the basis of what would eventually become known...as process philosophy. And I'll explain more on next episode.   Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "Henri Bergson pt. 1 - History",
        "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #145 on Henri Bergson. Check out the episode page HERESo maybe the best place to begin this episode is to talk about laughter as a marker of happiness. Should we consider laughter to be a true marker of happiness...like if we see someone who laughs all the time...can we reasonably assume that that person is happy? Well if not...can we assume that laughter is a thing that's GOOD for us in and of itself? Think most people would say it is...think most people would say we should try to laugh as much as possible. Laughter...is one of the most joyful experiences you can possibly have as a human being. Look at any antidepressant commercial...when they're reading off all the side effects those people are frolicing through the park laughing about something...I don't know what, but they sure look a lot happier than me.  But what's funny is that regardless of how much we value laughter, and aim towards it in our daily lives...when philosophers throughout history have tried to take a philosophical approach towards understanding WHY we laugh at things...the reasons we laugh often seem to carry with them some sort of negative connotation. We'll be looking at a few of them here today. Now, most historians of western philosophy will say that the first theories offered for WHY we laugh at things came out of ancient Greece in the era of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle...there almost certainly were theories before this by the presocratics, but...history is a set of lies we all agree upon, right? And we gotta start somewhere so let's just get into it.  There is ONE big plus though...for trying to understand laughter by starting during the era of Socrates. Two themes that were CENTRAL to the theater of this period of Athens: comedy and tragedy. We can see why there might be some sort of negative connotation that could come along with why we laugh when you compare comedy and tragedy. Because as much as they may SEEM like polar opposites at first glance...Something tragic happens: you cry...the ultimate expression of sadness. Something comedic happens: you laugh...the ultimate expression of joy. But when you really take a closer look at these two things something you realize VERY quickly is just how similar the two are. Consider the fact that in both comedy and tragedy there is often a problem that arises, both formats usually cite the reality that we live in a world of complex competing forces that are mostly out of our control, and in both these formats the lens is turned outward, observing the world around the characters, mostly concerning socio-political issues, at which point a character steps up and tries to offer a solution to a problem that faces everyone in society.  While the SOLUTIONS offered by these two different approaches are VERY DIFFERENT...both of them ultimately aim to subvert the expectations of the viewer. There are certain, patterned ways that we look at the world around us...comedy and tragedy are designed to present a different perspective.  Within a tragedy...some hero may sacrifice themselves or die for some sociopolitical cause, looking to have their death evoke some sort of change...while in comedy the goal is more to shift public consciousness by mocking how ridiculous things have gotten.  You know, Voltaire had STRONG thoughts on humor and its utility in the public realm. During his time he would just MERCILESSLY make a mockery of Rousseau and his thinking...and he has a famous quote describing why he did it, I'm paraphrasing a bit here but the idea is that he thought once you can get people to LAUGH at something...they never take that thing quite as seriously ever again. He didn't want Rousseau's work to become some sort of anointed political stone tablets. By the way this is the SAME reason if any of you are thinking of becoming the dictator of a small country...why if there is someone ruthlessly making fun of you in public to everyone...this is why most of your dictator colleagues drag that person off into an alley and they're never seen again. You need to maintain that status of infallibility. Comedy, in other words, is not just telling knock knock jokes...comedy can be one of the most powerful tools a society has to speak truth to power...and I'm sure we can all think of examples of comedians, TV shows, movies, books, etc. that serve this very purpose. More on that later.  Now obviously the comedies concerned with sociopolitical commentary are far different than the comedy you watched last week starring Adam Sandler. But somebody might want to ENGAGE in a comparison between the two to try to get to the bottom of what makes us laugh at all. Why do these two VERY different things BOTH make us laugh? Philosophers all throughout history have tried to figure out what exactly do we mean when we say something is funny, and what makes it funny?  Ultimately today's episode is going to lead to a famous essay by Henri Bergson called Laughter and in it...he wants to examine the relationship between people and the comic. By comic...he's not talking about a person who tells jokes...by \"the comic\" he more means \"the comedic\" or \"the funny\". He wants to examine it...but he wants to do it from a different angle than has typically been done historically.  See all throughout the history of Western Philosophy thinkers have been pretty excited to USE philosophy to understand things metaphysically or epistemologically. This tendency has limited them to Bergson...because so often when they look at something like the question \"what is funny\"...they'll immediately try to understand what we MEAN by the concept of funny...what MAKES something funny...in other words, they try to CATEGORIZE it and nail it down.  Bergson is more interested in examining the relationship between funny...and the internal experience of human beings. This may seem like just a slight shift in perspective, but it's emblematic of Bergson and the scope of his work. Bergson believed that our long history of looking at everything in such spatial terms made us almost completely neglect to use philosophy to look at many aspects of the internal experience of people. He actually wonders at one point in his work if since the dawn of the scientific revolution philosophers had taken a different course, and instead of trying to understand the external world they endeavored to understand our internal world...how might the field of psychology look today? A field that during HIS time was practically in its infancy.  So that said...I've thought about it a lot and I think the best way to understand Bergson is to structure it like this: first I want to just SAY WHY Bergson thinks we laugh at things, just get it out there... which probably wont make much sense right now, then I want to do a bit of a historical overview of several key philosophers and why THEY thought we laugh at things, and then I want to return to Bergson and explain how these theories throughout history relate back to what we initially talked about.  Bergson believes that any time we find ANYTHING funny...it is because at some level we are witnessing what he famously calls, \"the mechanical encrusted upon the living\". Let me explain. Think of some random object out there...let's just talk about a tree. A tree is not funny in and of itself. You don't just look at a tree and start laughing. The very concept of something being funny, to Bergson, is an extremely humanistic activity. Things aren't funny to the universe...they're not funny to gravity...or bacteria...things are funny to other human beings...funny is a HUMAN activity...and everything that we find funny, ultimately to Bergson, is us seeing something that looks mechanical within human behavior, behavior that is otherwise, fluid, elastic and constantly in flux. This hallmark of the late nineteenth century...to put rigid, mechanical parameters on something that is ACTUALLY fluid and constantly in flux causes us to laugh, now...there's obviously much more to this...but to understand how Bergson arrived here let's look at some other theories throughout history and try to spot how these theories might relate back to what I just said.  So one of the earliest known theories when it comes to what makes something funny...taken up by philosophers like Plato, Thomas Hobbes and partially in the work of Aristotle, Rene Descartes...is something that has come to be known as the superiority theory. The basic point is this: when we laugh at things it is because at some level we feel superior to some element of the joke or situation. Laughter is a response to this feeling of superiority.  You know a common saying is that there is always a VICTIM in comedy...there is always a butt of the joke. This theory offers an explanation for why that HAS to be the case. Let's talk about some examples...maybe the most basic one is slapstick humor.  You and your friends are walking through the woods...your friend in front of you is looking back telling everyone about how they're about to start their own vape store...and they trip over a log and faceplant into some sort of shrub and EVERYBODY laughs, now...the Superiority theory would say that you and your friends are laughing at that because you're getting a certain amount of joy in knowing that you are superior to this person in this moment. So if we extend this line of reasoning this is why stand up comedians might be prone towards self deprecating humor...because the audience can always laugh at how pathetic they are...this could be why in comic strips the go to strategy is for some character to say something really, really dumb...this could be why in movies funny scenes are OFTEN written to have a character in a super embarrassing situation that they can't get out of. Common to all of these is that the audience feels superior to the butt of the joke.  Whether you agree with this or not, should be said, there are certainly things you could point to that seem to verify the legitimacy of this...for example how bout the fact that we feel COMPLETLY different, when we are being laughed WITH...as opposed to laughed AT. When you're laughed AT by a group...it's almost like you're being seen as lesser, than the other members of the group. Being laughed AT immediately brings up a sense of a hierarchy in our heads.  Now, the problem with this theory ended up being a lot of different things not the least of which is...that if we're going to start with the premise that what evokes laughter is a feeling of superiority over something...then why do we have such a strong capacity for pity? Why when we see people with health problems, relationship problems, financial problems...why are there so many cases of people being worse off than us that don't amuse us at all? We don't even come CLOSE to laughing in those cases. Also what about insects and plants that people often feel superior to? Why aren't those people walking around at the botanical gardens laughing like bozo the clown all the time? How bout the fact people often laugh at themselves? Superiority may be a part of the formula for what makes us laugh, but philosophers were quick to point out that there has to be something else going on here. So they went back to the drawing board.  Now another theory that came later...is that laughter is kind of like a pressure release valve. This is more commonly known as the Relief Theory, held by people like Herbert Spencer and Sigmund Freud. Proponents of this theory might say...think of laughter as sort of a psychological tool that helps us get back to homeostasis. Let me explain: often times within the boundaries of a single joke or group of jokes...there's a sort of nervous tension that begins to build...during the setup of the joke we start to feel a sense of pity for the subject of the joke and we start to develop expectations about their situation...only to find out on the punchline that those expectations were wrong and that all that mental energy we put into caring about them was a total waste of time and everything's actually completely okay.  For example take the very simple joke, \"Did you hear about the mathematician that was afraid of negative numbers? Yeah, he'd stop at NOTHING to get away from them!\"  First of all none of you judge me...I don't wanna hear it...point is this is a super simple example of the structure of some jokes...the first line is telling a story of somebody immersed in a career where they're terrified of something they have deal with every day. We might start to feel bad for this person, think of how miserable their life must be. Only to realize one sentence later that any mental energy we expended in that direction, was actually useless and any expectations we had were wrong. Now when you extend this theory to formats where you have more than two lines to work with...TV shows, Movies...stand up comedians are absolute masters of doing this over the course of paragraphs, maybe over the course of their whole set. When we've exerted mental energy towards caring about a character in a story only to find out it was a joke and that it actually didn't matter, to some supporters of the Relief Theory, we laugh as a psychological tool to release that tension and bring us back to homeostasis.  But other thinkers who are still proponents of the relief theory might disagree with the idea that the Relief Theory is this narrow. They might say, for example, look at this classic quote from Groucho Marx:  \u201cOutside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.\u201d Now, some people might laugh at that. But why if we're accepting the premises from before? There wasn't any nervous energy being built up to set up a thwarting of someone's expectations. He was only saying something positive before the punch line. Arguments like this led some philosophers to think of the relief theory in more macro terms. We go about the stresses of our everyday lives, in other words we fear things within our cultures, we suppress our desires, we create narratives and expectations of ourselves and others and our place in the world...all of this accounting for the true source of that nervous energy that needs to be relieved by laughter.  Think of somebody that goes to work all week...50-60 hours at their job, constantly building that pressure up and then goes out on friday to the comedy club to let off some steam. Or even goes home nightly and doesn't want to do anything but watch a funny show they like.  This reminds me of a theory Adorno had which is that as citizens of late stage capitalist totalitarian societies...we watch these products created by the culture industry...we watch these funny TV shows and movies and comedians and we laugh and it distracts us away... from the economic chains we walk around in every day of our life. What might otherwise be a sort of nervous energy that would increasingly build and result in people feeling so uncomfortable it would lead to revolution for Adorno...instead we're given bread and circuses to keep us at bay and laughter is the steam being released from the pressure cooker.  Nonetheless, as interesting as this theory is probably everyone listening can think of a TON of different things people laugh at that clearly have nothing to do with a release of built up nervous energy. But this theory was a CRUCIAL part of the history of these theories of what makes us laugh, so we have to know about it. Because even if philosophers think there has to be something else that accounts for laughter, maybe, just like in the case of the superiority theory, the relief theory is part of the answer.  The LAST of these big theories from history about what makes us laugh is probably the most popular theory in today's day and age...what's known as the Incongruity Theory. Sometimes called the Incongruous Juxtaposition Theory.  Now real quick it should be said for all three of these: the superiority theory, relief theory AND incongruity theory...I'm just covering the central theme of what these theories are trying to get across...every one of these had several major thinkers that appropriated them and each of those thinkers had their own unique details and terminology when it comes to how they approached them. My goal is not for us to understand everything ABOUT these theories...just the ideas to the extent that they are useful in understanding Bergson's theory later on.  That said the incongruity theory needs a little more explanation than the other two. The earliest sighting of the incongruity theory actually is by Aristotle in his work Rhetoric. He says the easiest way to get an audience to laugh is to somehow establish some sort of expectation in their heads...and then to violate it. Now, at first glance this may sound like the incongruity theory is saying that we laugh when our expectations are violated or we are surprised...but it's actually not that simple! Think about it, there are a lot of surprising things you could say... that really aren't that funny at all. For example if you were an alien that came down to this planet and you wanted to find out how to make humans laugh and you went to the library and read about this theory and thought it just meant surprising someone's expectations...someone comes up to you and says hello...you wanna make them laugh so you say welcome to minnesota...certainly that's a surprising response...but it's not FUNNY. They're not gonna laugh, they're gonna call the police.  Now what makes this an important point is that what makes us laugh is NOT in the incongruity in itself...we don't laugh JUST BECAUSE two things that are unrelated come together...the way it's COMMONLY described is that we laugh in the RESOLUTION of that incongruity. The thing that JARS our expectations NEEDS to fit within the context of whatever the story is or whatever conversation we're having. This idea of the context that we view things within is going to become extremely important when we start looking at the theory of Bergson.     Keeping in mind that context is important and that the comedy lies in the resolution of the incongruity not in the incongruity itself...we navigate our lives, we categorize the world around us, we label things, we group similar things together, we see which contexts things are \"supposed\" to be used in, we start to see patterns in the way the world unfolds and then we start to develop expectations of how things fit into the world. Laughter occurs when one of those expectations are violated, we feel a momentary sense of discomfort BECAUSE our expectations have been violated, and then that discomfort is resolved in various ways and it produces an affect we call laughter. There are several philosophers that were fans of this theory...Aristotle, Schopenhauer, Kant...in fact here is Kant in the Critique of Judgment describing the theory for himself: \u201cIn everything that is to excite a lively laugh there must be something absurd (in which the understanding, therefore, can find no satisfaction). Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing\u201d So some examples of this. Some stand up comedians are absolute masters at tying together two concepts that are incredibly familiar to us in an unfamiliar way...or two concepts that seem completely unrelated to each other in a way that actually makes total sense. TV shows and movies are very character driven...so we have expectations of the way a person is supposed to behave in a particular social context...when one of these characters violates it in a way that, as Kant said, is absurd and ultimately resolves into nothing...we laugh when we don't feel that STRAIN on our expectations anymore. This can also be said of sitting around with your friends having a funny conversation.  One of the biggest problems with this theory has proven to be that there are a ton of examples of incongruity that's absurd and resolves into nothing... that doesn't make people laugh...picture someone who's not a carpenter, going to a seminar full of journeyman carpenters, giving the keynote speech about drywall screws. No doubt violating expectations, no doubt absurd and resolving into nothing...no ones laughing. So if we want to claim that we've somehow found the FORMULA for laughter we have to be willing to accept that AGAIN, maybe this theory is part of it...but maybe there is more to it that we aren't considering. Maybe there IS no formula....or maybe these formulas have been too fragmented in the past. Henri Bergson's theory is often cited as a strange variation of the incongruity theory, but a better way to think of his theory is as a hybrid theory. He synthesizes the strongest parts of the superiority, relief, AND incongruity theories and then adds on a pragmatic social element of the function of laughter that helps us regulate our cultures and communities.  This idea...that laughter is something that's an important tool to help regulate society...this is an idea that we still are debating heavily to this day. There seem to be two sides to this debate. One is that comedy is an important tool used in the public realm to speak truth to power. The comedian or the comedic writer LOOKS at the world around them...observes the way that things are...they see things that are ridiculous and they point them out ACTIVELY trying to get other people to notice them in an attempt to change their worldview...to put someone IN a position of power in check. Like we talked about with Voltaire...so that no one can take this person or these ideas quite as seriously ever again, AVOIDING the deification...AVOIDING the illusion of infallibility. Comedy is a powerful tool that has the ability to do this.  Now on the other hand there are others that would say that comedy is ALSO a forum for the completely absurd and disingenuous. That comedy is EQUALLY...NOT something where you're getting up on stage holding a press conference about your views on the world...quite the opposite...the GOAL of comedy is to get laughs...there are TONS of comedians that make their living saying things that are WAY over the top that they clearly don't believe, and no one in the crowd thinks they believe it, but they say it simply BECAUSE it's completely ridiculous. BOTH of these different approaches to comedy fall under the same heading. But you can see the tension that might start to arise here...the people that believe only in the truth to power side of comedy might look at the absurd side of comedy and think they're saying things that are affecting people's worldviews that are maybe dangerous...the absurd side of comedy might look at the truth to power people and think they're pigeonholing comedy into these narrow parameters that excludes people that don't want to hear a political lecture, they just want to go down to the comedy club on Friday after work and laugh with their friends about nonsense.  Doesn't really matter who's right, but this tension between these two very different approaches INVITES people to try to come up with a theory for why we laugh at things...that can explain why we laugh at BOTH of these. They seem very different from each other. Some of your might be saying why does it have to be one or the other? Why can't comedy be both? We have blanket terms like Sports...that includes both football...and badminton. They're very different but both sports. Why can't comedy be the same way and I hear you! But we always arrive at the same conclusion. See just like in the Isaiah Berlin episodes: it's not enough to just say Why not both? and then wash your hands of the question. Fact is if we're going to say why not both...we NEED a theory of why we laugh at things that can explain why these two seemingly different things are actually very similar. This is what Henri Bergson tries to do in his famous essay from 1980 called Laughter. We'll be going into it in depth next episode as well as how laughter relates to the fluidity and elasticity of human behavior, the inspiration he took from the presocratic philosopher Heraclitus we covered on episode one, how this relates to time and we'll start looking deeper into his view of the universe rooted in process philosophy. Good news for YOU people is that the episode is already done...in fact the episode after THAT is 95% done. See I've been writing episodes in quarantine...I just haven't been feeling good enough to record them. But I do NOW! So, a person much smarter than me about podcasts told me that it is horrible for the show to release two episodes at once...so I will be releasing part two of this in four days...maybe three. We'll see if I can stay patient.  That said have a GREAT three or four days, spend time with the people you love.  Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "Bergson on Laughter pt. 2 - Vitalism",
        "spoken_text": "So in response to all the different theories about what makes us laugh that have been laid out historically...Henri Bergson presents his famous hybrid theory in his work released in the year 1900 understandably titled \"Laughter\".  Now by the end of our explanation here today... we're going to ultimately conclude with the idea that Bergson believes laughter at it's core is ultimately a message to other people. But to understand what he means by that we're going to need to have a deeper understanding of why he thinks we laugh when we witness \"the mechanical encrusted on the living\"...but to understand THAT we're going to need some more detail about one of the key ideas that helps him ground his entire worldview: process philosophy...and to get started doing that we have to go all the way back to episode ONE of this show...to a presocratic philosopher born in 535 BC...a man by the name, of Heraclitus.  So because it was seven years ago if Heraclitus was going to make a bumper sticker of the simplest way to put his biggest idea... it would be that HE thought the universe is always in a state of flux...or constant change. We could also think of flux in terms of the universe being ever flowing. Flowing between dueling polarities, day and night, good and evil, chaos and order, existence flows between things that seem to be opposites that are, in fact, two sides of the same coin. Two different states of a larger overall PROCESS...that is constantly in flux. Now...thinking of flux as being similar to flowing is actually very helpful when trying to understand Heraclitus in particular because as you might remember his most famous metaphor from one of his fragments is about a river. He says: \"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\" Picture yourself standing on the bank of a river. You step into the river for a second. You get out for a minute. You step back into the river. What the metaphor is saying is that when you step back in that river... you are NOT stepping into the SAME river. Because the river, the water, you stepped into before is now somewhere about a mile downstream. Seeing as how Heraclitus wasn't a kayaking instructor it seems like a pretty weird point for him to be making...so what was the LARGER point he was trying to make here? Well one of the points put in a more modern context that will help us understand process philosophy is that so often we stand on the bank of the river and we see that river as a freestanding, separate, static entity. This is the Nile River a land surveyor might say. In fact, all throughout history to Bergson scientists and philosophers have tried to do this with things much BIGGER than a river...they've sometimes tried to do it with the entire universe! But Heraclitus is saying that the universe is not made up of a bunch of static, separate, distinct objects that can be cataloged and compared up next to each other to be able to understand them...there is something more fundamental about the universe that seems to him to be more like the flow of a river, and what's more is that to Heraclitus it seems that it's not just the UNIVERSE that is flowing...as observers...we seem to be flowing as well.  Well similar to the river example is the more MODERN, popular example of the sand dune. Picture a sand dune on a windy day...and for whatever reason a scientist decides they're going to try to empirically quantify what exactly that sand dune is. Like we talked about a couple episodes ago there's a SENSE in which by the time you get done making your first measurement of one little piece of that sand dune...the sand dune has shifted, and morphed and turned into something else. It can seem impossible to take an accurate snapshot of what that sand dune is in any single moment.  See, but to Bergson, even THIS is already making a mistake in thinking...to even think of the sand dune in this way...is to think of the sand dune and what it is in terms of what can be spatially measured and quantified in this moment. But is the sand dune ever REALLY defined by this moment? When you actually look at the sand dune it starts to look a lot LESS like a bunch of distinct parts that someone can measure and quantify...that can then later be assembled next to each other like building blocks and then we can eventually recreate something we call a sand dune...no, a sand dune starts to look MORE like a continuous, fluid PROCESS...a process of parts that interpenetrate each other, parts that NEED each other, parts that cannot be broken down or separated or else we aren't looking at the full sand dune at all. What I'm saying is that the sand dune never TRULY exists in a single moment that can be cordoned off, quantified and recorded by a scientist or philosopher.  This tendency we have though, to look at things in terms of what they are in THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT is why Bergson thought it was so important to explain process philosophy through the example of time. Bergson used the word time as we all do in a casual every day sense. He completely understood that we need clocks and seconds, minutes and hours to be able to function well in social life...we need to know when it's time to pick the kids up from school...we need to know when the bus is going to get to the bus stop...but outside of this he thought our understanding of time was yet another example of us projecting our thousands of years of spatially biased thinking onto a universe that can't be fully understood spatially. There's probably no better example of this than the common idea of a time line. Imagine you're watching a video and there's the bar underneath that allows you to click to any point in the video. This video represents the world as we're living in it and the time line underneath represents the way we commonly perceive time. The thinking is that there is a line of events that have occurred... that can be subdivided into tiny increments...and these increments lay side by side on this time line allowing us to go back to any single snapsnot, in that timeline and see it as distinct from all the rest...for example, we say things like I met this person at this second, on this hour of this day. In other words, we have GPS coordinates for moments in time... we think of time spatially...NOT ONLY in terms of locating specific moments in time, but we even think of the increments of time, like seconds, as though they're these things that are distinct from each other and quantifiable. As though THIS second stands alone from the second that came before or after it.  Bergson thinks what we typically call seconds are not distinct, separate moments at all...these \"moments\" (if you even want to call them that) interpenetrate each other. They are interconnected and cannot exist without each other. In fact, Bergson wants to get away from the name time altogether, the technical term that HE uses is DURATION, and duration is a holistic, connected and continuous process...NOT unlike the sand dune. To try to quantify it in any single moment would be missing the point of what it is you're even trying to measure and understand in the first place, and HERE'S THE BIG POINT! Whenever we try to spatially quantify ANYTHING that is more fundamentally a continuous process...we only end up distorting the phenomena that we're trying to study.  Now, we don't just do this with sand dunes and clocks...we do this with all KINDS of things...we do this with consciousness...we try to break down the different parts of consciousness to be able to understand it better...we do this with identity, the pieces of our identity work together like a unique set of puzzle pieces, we do this with human behavior, we do this with what drives life at all...which brings me to Bergson's next big point here: Mechanism. Remember his idea that we laugh when we witness the mechanical encrusted upon the living? Well we're actually talking about what he MEANS when he says mechanical.  By mechanical he's referencing a way of viewing the universe popular in the late 19th century...the idea that everything can be explained by looking to material and mechanical principles to be able to explain it...we break things down into their component parts, we try to understand each part and how it works and then we try to understand the THING by seeing how those parts all work together almost like gears in a machine. The point is these machines are multiplicities...they are a bunch of different things assembled together to make something else...Bergson of course wants to look at processes, which are by contrast singular, continuous with their parts not being distinct from each other. This is going to be a key distinction he uses when laying out his theory of why we laugh at things: process vs mechanism, but the more technical way to put that in the case of Bergson would be VITALISM vs Mechanism.  Let me explain because this brings me to the last piece of the puzzle that'll allow us to understand his theory of laughter and that is a look into one of the answers Bergson gave to the big questions that faced the thinkers of his time. Once again Bergson's living during the late 19th early 20th centuries...the theory of Evolution is at the forefront of people's minds...now for people like Bergson who believed that evolution was a scientific fact...what was more on HIS mind was finding ways to not only justify the theory but also to explain little scientific loose ends that people believed at the time that didn't seem to be fully understood yet.  Now whether we're talking about life as a process or we're talking about evolution as just a theory to explain what is going on one thing that you eventually HAVE to recognize is that whatever this thing is it seems to be changing...and at times to Bergson it seems to be changing creatively. Which is a pretty curious spot to be in if you're a thinker during this time...how do you account for this change? What is directing it if anything? And if there IS some creative element to that change...what is the source of all the new stuff it's creating?  You can imagine why Bergson thought this was an important question worth answering...consider the two dominant theories trying to account for the change of evolution during his time: the mechanistic and the teleological. See some thinkers thought that we could understand the inner workings of life and nature almost as though it's a machine with a bunch of different parts working together, again the popular mechanistic view. Bergson thought this was wrong because that explanation could NEVER fully account for new things being created out of evolution. Reason being is that IF life is emerging and it resembles something like a machine...then nothing new could really come out of it...because everything new would have to be borne out of the existing, finite set of cogs and gears that it has, whatever those are. Now on the other hand there were people of his time that accounted for the change by pointing to final causes...or various forms of finalism...the idea that HUMAN BEINGS are an ENDPOINT that evolution is aiming towards...a SQUIRREL is an endpoint, a MOOSE is an endpoint. Not only does this not account for the creative evolution that Bergson saw he thought it completely ignores a lot of the discontinuity between species and even how some species have very different characteristics in one location as opposed to another.  Bergson's solution to this problem is his famous concept of elan vital...loosely translated to vital impulse...or an impulse... rooted at the origin of life... that accounts for the creation of all the species. To explain the discontinuity of all the species he offers up two primary factors that he calls instinct and intelligence. This is where we can understand the contrast he marks between the traditional mechanistic view of things and what would eventually become known as Bergson's Vitalism (hence the vital impulse)...See if the mechanistic view says that nature is like a machine, then Vitalism is going to say that life is actually a process...a process that has it's own rules and norms ...and that the laws of things like physics and chemistry cannot adequately describe or account for all that goes on in this life process. The idea was that both physics and chemistry are scientific approaches towards understanding how the material world operates...life is not wholly material...and to try to use our understanding of matter to make sweeping claims about our understanding of life would just be too far of a reach to Bergson. Not to mention this goes BACK to the fact that Bergson believed human methods of analysis LIKE physics and chemistry were incapable of studying these sorts of processes without distorting what they were trying to study. These sorts of mechanical, spatial approaches being applied to the process of life...you could almost say this would be like the mechanical being encrusted on the living.   Now it doesn't really matter whether or not bergson's CRACKED THE CODE of evolution. And his lengthy explanation for why instinct and intelligence account for the differentiation between species really wouldn't be relevant to our discussion here today. So out of respect to YOUR time, the important point we need to take from his work in Creative Evolution is that we live in a bit of a paradox as human beings between instinct and intelligence. See on one hand we are the ONE SPECIES that wants to know about the complex inner workings of the process of life and how it operates...and yet, because we always have to use our intelligence to be able to ARRIVE at that knowledge...we are the ONLY species that can't get intimate access to it. See other animals have no PROBLEM accessing this vital impulse that Bergson talks about...they live a much more intuitive existence than human beings do...we on the other hand use mechanistic thinking, spatial thinking, scientific analysis to try to understand the process. Well we already know how that worked out with the sand dune...we can't use intelligence to get access to elan vital because simply by virtue of imposing ANY human created system of analysis we are distorting the very phenomena we're trying to study.  You probably no doubt see parallels between THIS sort of argument and things like the observer effect. Well this places Bergson FIRMLY in a tradition that was popular during the early twentieth century that would come to be known as intuitionism.  Now all that said...we can finally understand what he means when he says that we laugh when we witness the mechanical encrusted upon the living. The true nature of life, of human behavior and of human behavior within societies is driven by this vital impulse or vitalism. In other words the mechanistic view is wrong. Society is not a machine, nature is not a machine, and we are not the cogs and gears that make it up. Human behavior is a process...it is fluid, flowing between different polarities, singular, continuous, and the parts that make it up are not distinct and separate...their existences rely on each other, a person is not exactly who they are without the people on either side of them.  Now we can try all day long to try to use our intelligence to scientifically break down human behavior and society...and we DO, through psychology and sociology among other things...but as undeniably useful as that information will be to us practically in this moment, we are only, to Bergson, distorting what we are trying to study and will never be able to have access to the overall process that is going on or elan vital. The only way we can gain access to THOSE things, again, is through intuition.  To Bergson this explains why no single philosophical or scientific theory has been able to explain why we laugh at things. See when you and your friends are walking through the woods, your friend in front of you is going on about the vape store they're going to open up, and then they trip over a log and ruthlessly attack a rhododendron with their face...whether you realize it or not, intuitively you are at some level assessing somebody who is a direct threat to the health and fluidity of society. See we know at some intuitive level as people...the process oriented nature of life and of human society. We intuitively have ACCESS to this vital impulse whether we realize it or not...we know at some level that the success or failure of our societies often times spells the life or death of us as individuals. So when somebody engages in a behavior that starts to resemble mechanization, death or robotic-like automatism, we see that as something that could be a direct threat if it continues and laughter...begins to serve as a corrective action in that effort.  Laughter is a mediator between Vitalism and Mechanism to Bergson. To be a functioning member of society in touch with this vital impulse that drives us.... takes a certain amount of flexibility as a person. The world can throw a LOT of things your way as a citizen of a society...we need to keep our wits about us and Bergson thought one of the worst things you can be is overly rigid. Bergson thought it was SO EASY to fall into the trap of what he called the easy automatism of acquired habits.  Now according to my friend...her name is Merriam Webster...and I know that's usually two last names just a CRAZY coincidence I guess...but according to her the word automaton means: a moving mechanical device made in imitation of a human being. When people start to resemble automatons more so than they resemble vital, functional members of society, we witness one key example of how the mechanical is encrusted on the living.  So, when your friend trips over the log... because they are so distracted and are hyper focused on some set of plans they have...in that moment they resemble an automaton programmed to start a vape store, far more than they resemble a functioning member of the process of society. They can't BE flexible to whatever society throws their way...because quite frankly they're too distracted to be paying attention to it. Bergson would call this a \"lack of elasticity due to absentmindedness.\" This is why we laugh at them. Because if everyone lived their life so distracted that they can't even see the log sitting right in front of them...then society wouldn't last very long at all. Laughter becomes the way we communicate to this person that they need to lock in and get it together.  Another example Bergson gives is a type of person we might more commonly call a conformist. This is a member of society that to Bergson has fallen asleep at the wheel. They accept whatever narrative is thrown their way, they accept their place within it...they're told what to do and they LIKE it that way because it's easy. The example Bergson gives is of a business person with their strict, rigid dress code, the rigid decorum of behaviors that's expected of them, the power poses and Tony Robbins affirmations in the mirror every morning...you see I even started to try to do it right there...it's so easy to start trying to laugh at this person's expense because if everybody blindly committed to some role that they just fell into one day then we wouldn't have enough resistance against the current dominant narrative at any one time...society in other words would be less vital or healthy to Bergson.  One more type of person that lacks elasticity is somebody that goes too far in the OTHER direction. Bergson calls this type of person somebody with \"separatist tendencies\". This is someone that goes against the glue that holds society together at a level, that if left unchecked...might actually do some harm. Good example of THIS in comedy is maybe a WACKY sitcom or movie character. Or picture a stand up comedian talking about some crazy thing they do when they're out in public. This is the OPPOSITE of the conformist...this is someone who REFUSES to conform and is alienated from the fluidity of the social process because of it.  Generally speaking though, what's common among ALL these examples is that they are all pushing the envelope of behavior that will maintain a vital, healthy society...but Bergson would want to point out that what's interesting to consider is that we have ANOTHER group of people that often push the envelope of what's good for society, CRIMINALS!  We have an obvious solution for criminals...we put them in jail. But these minor offenses... where people really aren't HURTING anyone else...they're just lacking elasticity...we're not gonna put them in JAIL for that...but society STILL NEEDS some manner of recourse. That is where laughter comes in for Bergson. Laughter is a self administered antidote where people pay a minor social price for the sake of having the most vital society possible.  So we can see now why Bergson's theory is considered more of a hybrid theory of laughter. You could make a case that there are pieces to this that match the superiority theory. You could say that this is a variation of the incongruity theory, and tons of other bits and pieces from the hundreds of theories out there. What's interesting though is that Bergson's theory SEEMS to account for the discrepancy we talked about at the end of last episode...the question of why it is we can laugh at BOTH, comedy that speaks truth to power AND comedy that is just completely absurd. When you think of laughter as a tool to promote social vitality and health...then OF COURSE...OF COURSE we'd laugh at people pointing out how people in power are being ridiculous, we need our leaders to be in check...and OF COURSE we'd laugh at someone saying something totally absurd or over the top...because even if we know at some level that they don't mean any of it...just IMAGINING this being a real member of society engages that part of us.  But just to play devil's advocate...what about somebody that tells a joke for the sake of telling a joke? You know how the kids do it...what do they do? Wanna hear a joke? And then the other person laughs...there's no corrective action going on there...they're just telling JOKES! Maybe somebody that can offer some insight here is Aristotle. He has a section in his work where he talks about the function of eyesight. See you can ask the question what is the function of eyesight the same way you can ask what is the function of laughter. The same way you could say that we laugh because it serves a purpose, it maintains social vitality...you could say we see because it serves a purpose, it allows us to see predators, allows us to pick food, work together in groups, etc.  But Aristotle says how horrible would it be if the only time you ever got to use your eyesight was when it was doing something useful for your survival? What if every time you weren't doing something to immediately survive you just went blind? Wouldn't be fun Aristotle says and why? Because sometimes you just want to enjoy the view. Sometimes you just want to look out the window and see things for the sake of seeing them.  Now Aristotle is eventually going to use this to talk about why philosophy is important. People of his time loved to say that the value of philosophy is that it gives us tons of useful benefits at the level of society. Not unlike Bergson's view of laughter. But Aristotle is going to say that a true philosopher is capable of loving wisdom for wisdom's sake. Sometimes there IS no practical benefit to engaging in philosophy...sometimes it's just an activity that's worth doing for the fun of it...something you can do and you don't even NEED wifi or 5G or a floppy disk drive or any of that fancy computer stuff people have nowadays.  What if it's equally possible to do this with laughter? What if laughter undeniably provides us with social benefits, but it's also entirely possible to just laugh for the sake of laughing...and that we don't need some superiority theory or incongruity theory or all this overthinking to explain it.  No matter WHY you're laughing though Aristotle has some advice for you. He'd say make sure you never find yourself too extreme on either SIDE of humor. What he means is always make sure that you're not that person that can't take a joke, where everything needs to be a serious, productive conversation all the time...but equally make sure you're not that annoying person on the other side, laughing and joking about everything no matter HOW serious it is while the world's on fire all around you. Laughter can definitely be a convenient distraction. Which reminds me with ALL this talk about jokes and laughter these last couple episodes...this type of person aristotle's referencing reminds me of one of my favorite passages about humor that I'll leave you with here today...ironically from Kierkegaard...posted this on twitter before, Kierkegaard...says...this: A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.  Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "ep": "Episode #147",
        "title": "Being and Becoming",
        "spoken_text": "So with all this recent talk about comedy I thought it would be fitting to BEGIN our episode here today with a passage from the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his famous book The Will to Power. Nietzsche writes this: \"Perhaps I know best why man alone laughs: he alone suffers so deeply that he had to invent laughter. The unhappiest and most melancholy animal is, as fitting, the most cheerful.\" See Nietzsche had a special place in his heart for comedy...AND a special place for it in the work of a philosopher. He famously said he has a ranking...for philosophers. NOT based on how good their ideas are, NOT based on how sound their arguments are...but simply by their ability to use HUMOR in their work.  Now as fans of philosophy this can initially be a little confusing...WHY would Nietzsche ever even CONSIDER the legitimacy of a philosopher's work in terms of how many knock knock jokes they're telling? Well his ULTIMATE point is going to be instructive towards our episode here today...but it's going to take a few minutes to understand exactly where he's coming from...the BEST place to start is going to be all the way back where we began LAST episode...through the work of the presocratic philosopher Heraclitus and his famous debate with ANOTHER presocratic philosopher Parmenides.  So we already talked about Heraclitus...the doctrine of radical flux, the universe being in a constant state of change, not unlike the flowing of a river. Well if this was Heraclitus then the OPPOSITE can be said of Parmenides. His famous line if you remember from all the way back then is what is, is...what is not is not or in other words, what we mere humans PERCEIVE as change that's going on in the universe all around us is actually an illusion. He calls the illusion that we live in \"the way of opinion\" and he thought our flawed senses deceive us in a world of appearances and that actual TRUTH about the state of things is eternal and unchanging.  Now out of this famous debate between Heraclitus and Parmenides came one of the most famous debates in the history of philosophy. That is the contrast of what is later called Being vs Becoming. But it's ALSO the major thru line of our epis ode here today.  So a philosopher that favors the concept of Being believes there is a way that things are...and our job as scientists and philosophers is to go out there and use whatever tools we have available to FIGURE OUT the way that things are. These people historically often look at the world spatially because they often THINK about existence in terms of subjects and objects, they often favor terms like substances, concepts, forms, etermal truths...the basic idea is look around you...there's obviously a way that things are, let's categorize and understand what it is.  Now people that are fans of BECOMING...or the process oriented way of thinking we've been talking about the last few episodes...they don't believe there's a way that things are in the traditional way that phrase is used. Things are fundamentally a process of constant change and if we haven't intuitively recognized it in the past it's really just because, what's the famous saying? We're mayflys in the cosmos? We just don't live long enough or are born into a historical tradition of ideas...or lack the perspective to be able to see it.  Nietzsche wouldn't have been surprised that Heraclitus, the guy associated with becoming and the more process oriented way of thinking, he wouldn't have been surprised that he was a funny guy. Because this is a great example of why Nietzsche values comedy in a thinker's work. One of the things that makes Nietzsche such a great writer is that he commonly utilizes BOTH comedy AND tragedy in his work. See because part of the ESSENCE of both comedy and tragedy to Nietzsche is a direct negation of BEING, in this being and becoming...which put another way is to say that both comedy and tragedy directly concern themselves with a denial or a subversion of \"the way that things are.\" Think about it...think of the job of a comedian. What do they do? They look at the world around us...they see something most people see as just an ordinary reality of the world...and by making fun of it they SHOW people that this thing ISN'T the way that things are...this is just some absurd way that we're doing things right now that's eventually going to transform into some OTHER absurd thing that they'll be sure to make fun of then.  Think about tragedy. There is a current state of things in the socio-political realm. Great tragedies often include a person or a group of people making some sort of tragic sacrifice for the sake of making a STATEMENT about the way that things are and how they need to change.  See to Nietzsche one of the marks of a great philosopher is not to just accept the way that things are and never question them...that's kinda the OPPOSITE of your job. So this is ONE of the reasons why when he's applying his thought to the way that things were near the end of the nineteenth century...he pointed out how while many people thought this was the greatest age of technological advancement (sounds familiar)...he also thought this was simultaneously a period of most people's blind adherence to the masses. Which, for Nietzsche came along with a period of people having an inherent desire for social conformity.  Whenever you say something like, \"I am a THIS!\"...\"I am a card carrying member of this GROUP!\" You are thinking about your identity in terms that are a lot more like Being than Becoming. There is a way that things are...there is a way that I AM. Here's how I can nail myself down as a person in RELATION to this way that things are.  But this is not the best way to think about our identity to not only Nietzsche but MANY of the existentialists. Some of them would say...sure, there is an aspect of you that is Being, there IS a way that you are right this split second...but there's a sense in which by the time you even get to the end of this SENTENCE, you will have changed in small, incremental ways...you will be a little bit older, you'll have developed your views on being and becoming in some small way, you will have moved positions spatially, you're body will have run many processes trying to keep you healthy, your career and relationships will be in a slightly different place...in other words...you may look in the mirror every day and not notice the small incremental changes, but everybody would admit they are a different person today than they were five years ago. Now if we took a snapshot of something you said on facebook five years ago...does that encapsulate who you are?  So lets say you WERE TRAPPED in one of these groups, where your identity feels like something given to you each day...like something branded into your side so the other members know you're one of them...you can start to feel a little stuck...like there's something static and fixed about who you are, this can LEAD to a sort of malaise that Nietzsche describes in great detail. Thinkers of the time tried to offer antidotes to this feeling for people. They recommended turning BACK to religion, or turning BACK to the great poets and literary works of the past...the thinking being to try to revive some semblance of sentimentality that existed in a former world. But Nietzsche thought NONE of these things could offer you any sort of real relief. The ONLY thing that could offer you relief to Nietzsche, was human will, taking action, to affirm life as a creative, on going act...to exert your will to power. In other words, to get away from viewing our identity in terms of being, and to see yourself more in terms of becoming. And here's the big point: we recognize this intuitively when it comes to our identity. Think of all the parallels to the way scientists and philosophers have been trying to create categories and brand an identity into the universe itself.  The same way there's no static fixed eternal YOU...There is no static, fixed, predictable stability in the universe. And in both cases...The only way you could possibly think there is is because you're only viewing it from your incredible narrow perspective that you have access to. Look around you right now and pick something in the world around you that is a stationary object. Now from your obvious, single person perspective what rational person could ever think that that thing is not some static entity that is a fixture in the universe. But look at it from a different perspective...take a few steps back...in fact, take a few light years worth of steps back and look at that thing from a different perspective outside our solar system and you will actually see that it is hurling through space at almost 70,000 miles an hour and is spiraling around a nuclear explosion that is also hurling through space. You may not be able to see it from minute to minute, but take a coffee table for instance...looks like a static piece of wood...when in reality it has been undergoing a constant, slow process of decay from the moment it was removed from a tree. When you view things in terms of being instead of becoming...you instantly bring to bear a host of metaphysical assumptions that determine not only the questions you think are worth asking about the universe...but the very way you see the concepts of truth and knowledge at all.  Now both Nietzsche and Bergson are part of this movement in the late nineteenth century that came to be known as Naturalism. But they were very different from a lot of OTHER Naturalists. Good PORTION of these Naturalists were what is called material reductionists...or the idea that the material world should be the primary or ONLY object of our study...but also that everything ABOUT the universe could be understood if only we could understand the most fundamental PHYSICAL parts that make things up.  The way I think every philosopher professor in existence has ever described this goes like this: We have a certain psychology that is in many ways mysterious to us, but it can understood by appealing to a more fundamental field known as biology. Now our biology is incredibly complex, but in many ways it can be understood by our knowledge of this elaborate confluence of chemical reactions, atoms molecules that we know as chemistry. But those atoms and molecules can be better understood when we look at them though the lens of physics. Physics begats chemistry which begats biology which then begats psychology, in other words, the thinking is if we can just thoroughly understand the physics and the material components that make something up...then we can understand processes like psychology that remain mostly mysterious to us.  But process philosophers from around this time like Bergson thought the material reductionists were way off here. Came up with an example to try to illustrate one of their main arguments.  Picture you're going to IKEA to try to pick out an end table...you find one, grab some meatballs on your way out and head home to put it together. Now in example A...you follow the directions and put that end table together perfectly...i mean the thing is glowing as it's sitting there. But in example B...you decide to get a little more creative. Let's say this time you don't give a hootinany about the directions. You got the shelf sticking off to the side...got some diagonal pieces...you take all the remaining bolts and position them on the top like they're playing a kick ball game against each other, maybe a couple towers...Now place example A right next to example B. That perfectly assembled end table in NO WAY resembles that abstract art project at all...but... the materials that make them up are exactly the same. The materials that make something up are not the entirety of what something is. The same way you can't know everything about me by studying the atoms in my body, you can't know everything about the universe by JUST analyzing it spatially, or at a material level. You can have SOME understanding, for sure, but there is clearly more going on here...might that be a more fundamental underlying process that the scientific approach of the late 19th century can never get access to because they're thinking of things so spatially. Might philosophers of the past have been so completely incorrect because they're beginning from a set of metaphysical presuppositions that have been taken as gospel from the time of Plato? For process philosophers this Newtonian methodology of analyzing the universe is an outdated scientific paradigm that runs into very important barriers and we need to recognize its limitations. Remember, thinkers like Bergson are living in the wake of the work of Charles Darwin. We never made much headway with the Newtonian model when it comes to understanding a lot of the non-material components of the process of life...how it began, where it's directed. Thinkers like Bergson want to look at OTHER elements of existence that we haven't made much headway in understanding, and he wants to look at them from this same process oriented perspective. Things like consciousness, things like meaning, things like aesthetics this is WHY Bergson is so interested in internal human experience.  Now there was a MASSIVE scientific revolution at the beginning of the 20th century. Dozens of thinkers including Albert Einstein, general and special relativity...these people fundamentally changed the set of presuppositions science was using when trying to understand things. New PROCESS philosophers were living during this time too, fully aware of the work of Henri Bergson was the thinker Alfred North Whitehead. By the way...the real pronunciation is Henri Bergson...but that's not happening. But Alfred North Whitehead on the other hand...now THAT'S something I can say perfectly.  Maybe I should start this section on Whitehead by saying that this all can seem to people to be extremely hostile to science. But almost invariably these thinkers are not at ALL opposed to science...they're opposed to the way that science has become this monolith of truth in the eyes of people that live in modernity. The way we've been doing science so far is absolutely GREAT at studying the material of the universe, and pragmatically it does amazing things for us when being able to manipulate the material world around us and create things that make for greater possibilities...but to a process philosopher you can't just say \"Hey! look at this method I have that is really great at studying rocks!\" \"It undeniably provides TONS OF USEFUL benefits to us because of our understanding of those rocks!\" \"Therefore, it MUST be capable of understanding EVERYTHING about existence! Not that it has very REAL limitations built into it because it was ultimately created by human beings...no, whatever limitations there may seem to be...you just need to study more rocks and the truth of the universe will be revealed to you!\" Moving away from being and more towards becoming...may be as instructive towards understanding our own identity as it is towards understanding the universe. \u0016Because one thing's for sure to a process philosopher...ANY comprehensive account when it comes to understanding the universe...NEEDS TO INCLUDE things like meaning and consciousness and aesthetics and many others that science has formerly left us in the dark on...because THESE THINGS...are JUST as much a part of the universe as a rock is. We can't be satisfied with just understanding rocks. Now...this is the place that Whitehead wants to begin his metaphysical analysis.  We talked about the Newtonian paradigm and this new paradigm that came along and what's being referenced there is the famous book we talked about on an earlier episode: Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and in it...he talks about how there hasn't been just one scientific revolution that occurred all the way back during the time of Sir Francis Bacon. History is punctuated by many different scientific breakthroughs that caused the scientists of the time to change the ENTIRE SET of assumptions that they enter into experiments with. These dominant assumptions determine not only the research that gets funding or the thinkers tenured at universities, but they shade the very hypotheses that the scientists of the day think are reasonable to explore. We can see this pretty clearly when it comes to this Newtonian method getting piled on top of by this new method.  We can see this paralleled in philosophy in the work of Alfred North Whitehead. Living during the time of the development of general and special relativity...he can be seen as wanting to throw out the old metaphysical paradigms of philosophy and to try to create a new one that corresponds and works together with these incredible breakthroughs in the sciences. Metaphysics to Whitehead is not just about explaining how the physical world is the way it is like many philosophers have done in the past...metaphysics is the realm that he says sets the \"conduct of discussions\" the actual framework that we use to even be able to have a conversation about the way things are in the universe. Whitehead wants us to reimagine metaphysics and think about it in a whole new way.  You know...a thinker that is pretty similar to Whitehead in some ways is the guy we did a six part series on before named Gilles Deleuze...and Deleuze...similarly talks about metaphysics in a way that may seem pretty foreign to a lot of people unfamiliar with process philosophy...precisely BECAUSE he's LOOKING at things more from the metaphysical framework of BECOMING rather than one focused on BEING. The SAME WAY a scientist... living in the early 19th century... might hear someone talking about science in a POST Einstein world, and be utterly confused...may even say this is pseudo science, this is not even worth READING it's so OUT THERE and incomprehensible...SO TOO might someone who's not familiar with the concept of becoming and this process oriented approach...they might try to understand Deleuze and have a really hard time wrapping their head around it. Now of course I'm not necessarily talking about superiority of thought...just a difference in the metaphysical approach.  Deleuze would say things sometimes like that I want people to think of me PURELY as a metaphysician. Which initially might seem kind of weird...\"That's great Deleuze, but I just got done READING your work on politics. About to start reading your work on Epistemology...you remember that...remember the Rhizome you talked about with all the roots that connect in seemingly chaotic ways? How about all you had to say on aesthetics?\"  But to someone like Deleuze...these things are ALL derived from metaphysics. The fact philosophers in the past have tried to subdivide these non material things into their own categories and study them on their own...as though they're NOT interrelated to each other AND NOT interrelated to existence at large...this is a good example of why we run into this paradox of the fact that as human beings we are simultaneously the only tools we have to try to understand the chaos of existence, but man do we take what seems like a good idea and run too far with it sometimes.  Nietzsche might interject and describe us all as Human...all too human. You know we like to think that we are rational people. I'm not crazy YOURE crazy. I have the arguments to back up MY beliefs...the OTHER side doesn't! Just a bunch of animals over there! But Nietzsche would say HOLD ON A SECOND. We have a LONG history of thinkers telling us that we're these rational creatures...human REASON is what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. You want to be as RATIONAL as possible at all times. But even at our best are we really...that rational? Just as our rational minds exist perched inside of an animal body...so too do we try to harness the chaos of the universe with tools that are human, all too human. LANGUAGE is a big one for Nietzsche. Lot of people don't like Bergson for not wanting to talk about what processes are or exactly what they're like...but that's the problem...whenever we have to try to describe ANYTHING we have to go through language...but there is no guarantee that this symphony of grunts we've created is capable of describing ANYTHING accurately beyond basic human interactions...and you could argue it's not even very good at doing THAT either.  But we try, don't we? We want to remain optimistic. Language is all we have...maybe it IS capable of accurately describing everything. Process philosopher might see this as a similar line of thinking as the person who is overly optimistic about the limitations of science. And maybe this is the reason process philosophers seem to be so interested in humor. Because when you truly consider the levels of existence that we're trying to access...and you consider the utterly broken tools we have to do the job with...to go back to the quote at the start of the show...maybe the only thing the most melancholy of creatures can do...this sub species of primate on this tiny blue dot...maybe the only thing we can REALLY do about existence...is laugh.  Nietzsche thought once you accept a negation of being...a movement towards becoming...once you accept that there isn't a way that things are about you OR the universe...you can finally start to wrestle with two of the biggest problems that lie at the heart of the human condition. Number one...is how terrifying existence truly is, I mean we ALL KNOW BY NOW...that no matter how static and fixed the world may seem...no matter how there may SEEM to be a solid way that things are that isn't going to change...that entire facade can chip away in a matter of hours and you can find yourself face to face with an entirely NEW world and the reality you've been living in the whole time. Nietzsche says the other problem we have...is a constant campaign that has to be fought with the limitations of knowledge. Once you accept that we don't have access to objectivity, or eternal truths...once you accept that all you have is a perspective and all WE have is intersubjectivity...how can you reliably decide what you're going to believe? How do you stop other people from believing things that are patently false? How do YOU know what YOU believe isn't totally wrong? More relevant to US living in the world today...who gets to GIVE people their views on the order of things?  This show is never going to try to give you answers to any of these questions...but WHATEVER answers you find, consider the fact that if you ever feel stuck in EITHER of these problems Nietzsche lays out that there are a lot of people out there who have claimed to find a way out. Being and Becoming. Whether you're looking at yourself or the universe the best way this way out has EVER been described in the history of the world, and it's not even close I leave you with here today. I say that from a completely objective, non biased perspective at the top of a mountain while you all listen from the BOTTOM of the mountain: \"I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth \u2014 and truth rewarded me.\" Simone de Beauvoir Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "On Media pt. 1 - Manufacturing Consent",
        "spoken_text": "So I want to begin this series on media by talking about it from a bit of an alien perspective...or at least alien to how we often hear people TALK about media and what it is. Want to begin today by talking about the concept of media...as a plural form of the word medium. Cause ultimately that\u2019s what it is. You know..we don't often THINK of media in this way especially things like news media. Like how is the news typically described? Well it's often described as the fourth estate of government. The implication being that these people that REPORT the news to us are practically thought of as public servants...the tip of the spear... going out there into the world while we live our daily lives...they're the people that are gonna ask the tough, hard hitting questions that help keep us informed so that we can know what's going on and vote accordingly every four years. They're often framed as though they're performing a SERVICE for us, many of them PASSIONATE about the truth, PASSIONATE about getting to the bottom of what's going on. But what if we think of media as a plural form of the word medium...how would that change things? Dictionary defines medium as \"the intervening substance through which impressions are conveyed to the senses\"...another way it's defined is as \"the substance in which an organism lives or is cultured\".Now...regardless of any sort of fourth estate mythology that could be tacked on about news media...forget about what our culture TELLS us the media is doing for us...want to consider on the episode today that BOTH of these definitions of the word medium could EQUALLY describe the service that the news media provides for us. See to the thinkers we\u2019re covering today it may be incredible useful to think of the news media as an intermediary between us and reality. Meaning...the reality of the world is that we can't get on a jet ski and rocket across the ocean to see what's going on in Bolivia, for example. But man isn't it great... we have these thankless, truth loving public servants out there on the news that can do it for us...then create a nice little short set of moving pictures that tell us exactly what IS going on on the other side of the world.  Media in this way serves as a filter. The intervening substance through which impressions are conveyed to the senses. But another thing the thinkers today would want us to consider is that...say you could somehow have control over those impressions that are conveyed...to GIVE people their impressions of what the world is like...to have the only key to a lock on a door that people want opened for them every day...needless to say you'd have quite a bit of consolidated power. What would a media landscape look like if such a concentrated level of consolidated power existed? Would we even know it? Would it require a conspiracy on a level so vast that it would just be impossible? We're going to be exploring the origins of modern mass media today by looking at the work by Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman published in 1988 entitled Manufacturing Consent with many OTHER references to Chomsky's later work entitled Media Control.   Now the term Manufacturing Consent is actually a borrowed term. Rightfully so Chomsky and Herman begin making their case about media by alluding to the theories originally laid out by Walter Lippman in the early 20th century...a time they saw as a point in history where the filter of media between us and reality started to take on a very different role in our lives. Now right off the bat some of you out there may be wondering and rightfully so...when you live in a democracy...why does it even make sense to TRY to control media in the first place? How evil would you have to be, I mean, don't we ALL stand to benefit from people being educated...knowing what's going on in as accurate a way as possible? Well this is part of the beauty of Lippman's work...there are philosophical arguments you could make and DEFEND without being evil necessarily... that make a strong case for controlling what the average person consumes. Lippman says these ideas are nothing new...it was done through Lenin, it was articulated by Marx, the only thing relatively new here is that these same tactics are NOW starting to be done in the democratic societies in the early 20th century...so why would that benefit anyone at all? Lippman lays it out like this...there is a type of person out there that could think of a democratic society in terms of there being three major classes. We have on one hand...people that hold REAL positions of power...more on them in a second. The second class are what he calls the \"specialized class\" which are more or less just elected officials that do the bidding of the public in a democracy...and the third class is what he calls the \"bewildered herd\"..which are the rest of us... the masses, and just to clarify, these are NOT the views of Lippman himself...he is describing one way that people COULD view a democratic society. Now people that hold the REAL positions of power have ways that they control and direct the behavior of these OTHER two classes. They control the \"specialized class\" the elected officials by controlling the parameters of their entire lives AS elected officials. So in this way theoretically a politician with all the qualifications in the world...with the best INTENTIONS in the world...can not survive for very long or even win an election in the first place if they're not willing to play by the rules of the people that MAKE the rules. What inevitably happens next is they become tacitly indoctrinated into a way of getting things done politically...THIS is the way you do things in Washington if you want to become part of a committee that can actually get things done...you don't fundraise by appealing to certain powerful private interests, you don't get re-elected. You don't rub elbows with the right people in the existing government, your elbows are not going to be around for very long. Now so far this all makes sense, but the more DIFFICULT problem that has to be solved by people in positions of power...is how do we control the herd? Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed but there\u2019s a LOT of people out there...the masses are scary to people in positions of power. How do you control the multivariate nature of all the things they could possibly want? Well, to the people that believe in this view of society the herd is most effectively controlled...by keeping them distracted, in a number of different ways. But again this brings us back to the original question... why distract the herd in the first place...especially in a democracy? Why not give them access to the best information we possibly CAN so that they can VOTE in the best way they can? Chomsky gives a great example of the worldview behind this kind of thinking. He essentially says imagine you're a parent and you have a three year old kid that you need to take care of. For anyone that's been around a three year old...you KNOW...that kid is about four seconds away from destroying themselves at any point in time throughout the day...and to COMBAT this...as a parent... you need to set up an extremely narrow set of parameters for their existence. You may give them a toy to play with...you may put on some cartoons just so that you can have a few minutes where they are distracted enough to not explore the light socket with daddy\u2019s BBQ fork. But here\u2019s the thing Chomsky says...as a parent...you have the ability to GIVE that toddler as much freedom as you want really. You COULD give that toddler permission to run across the street anytime they thought it was a good idea. But why would anyone ever actually do that? ..not only would that be completely dumb...that would be downright irresponsible. And responsible is going to become an important word to these people in power that have this view of society. This is how people holding this view of society SEE members of the herd. We need to LIMIT the parameters of their lives...keep it VERY simple...keep them distracted. Give them some toys to play with. Give them some cartoons to watch, so they don\u2019t do too much damage with their complete lack of understanding while we let them explore the light sockets of the world. Similarly...we can\u2019t have a bunch of what they call \u201cirresponsible men\u201d running the show...we need responsible ones...ones that ACTUALLY know how to bring about positive change in a society...ones that recognize the dangers of giving the herd political power...because similar to the impulsive, unaware nature of the toddler running across the street, the herd reacts impulsively and often violently to the emotional stories of the day, lacking the knowledge and experience to make measured, long term decisions. Bottom line is: we need to treat the herd like they\u2019re little kids. Make them THINK they have freedom of thought, but again freedom is always freedom within certain parameters...and if we can LIMIT those parameters we can limit the possible world views that people can have and thus keep them in line more or less with what the \u201cresponsible men\u201d, the truly qualified individuals...have deemed to be the best way forward for the herd.Now...limiting what ideas are acceptable to believe has been pretty easy throughout human history...and it only becomes MORE easy within a totalitarian state. I mean people organize in the street with a message of political dissent that\u2019s inconvenient to the responsible class...you just send people out to the street to BEAT them into submission. But throughout the 20th century this has become less effective...largely in part due to democracy, freedom to assemble, freedom of expression...these things are spreading at a rate they never had before. So the people in positions of power had to come up with a new tactic...a new way to limit the parameters of people\u2019s thinking...while still making them BELIEVE that it was THEIR idea to hold the position that they defended and vote the way that they voted. This was the moment that people in positions of power came up with an idea... that would change the course of democracy in the age of mass media. Noam Chomsky has a quote about this, he says \u201cPropaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.\u201d The origins of this shift in strategy predate World War One...though Chomsky and Herman cite one of the big points of inception as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Creel Commission right around the TIME of the First World War...when working in coalition with the British Ministry of Propaganda they created a campaign to deliver specific messages... to a United States that at the time was not really that interested in getting involved in foreign affairs...they did this...to drum up support for a type of patriotism that aligned itself with US involvement in World War One. Well, the US ended up getting INVOLVED in WW1 in a big way...and the strategy worked SO well for the people in power that we can see an example of the same tactics immediately AFTER WW1 in McCarthyism and in the Red Scare. In other words the interests of corporations, the government and large institutions at the time benefitted from us entering into WW1 and to have communism as a pejorative via the red scare, and to Chomsky and Herman this new strategy of propaganda worked extremely well all the way up to around 1935 with the passing of the Wagner Act. Most notably...that it allowed laborers to organize and vote in a collective way that just had never been possible before. Once the effects of the Wagner Act started to show up...Once laborers started getting small levels of power over the interests of large corporations and people started getting elected that were actually acting on BEHALF of these workers, people in positions of corporate power had to do something to try to get things back to the way they were. Not a coincidence that just two years later in the year 1937 is the first time we see a brand new innovation in these media propaganda tactics...something that came to be known as the Mohawk Valley Formula. The Mohawk Valley Formula is a strategy where you use media to bust a strike. Meaning, that if workers have a problem with some policy that a corporation has because they feel like they\u2019re being mistreated...and they use this new power to organize to strike against that policy...the Mohawk Valley Formula is a formula...designed to align the motives of the strike with some message, that really has nothing to DO with the strike or the policy in question...that diminishes the support that the workers are going to get from the public. At the time it was popular to paint striking workers as Antiamerican. The motives of the laborers were against the interests of America and its future...so in other words they effectively switched the conversation AWAY from anything about specific policies that were being protested...and turned the conversation into whether you were FOR the interests of America or against them. Now I\u2019m not trying to make a point about unions or corporations or anything like that here...that\u2019s not what this show is...the significance of this when it comes to this series has less to do with Labor Unions and more to do with how we can see echoes of this VERY SAME strategy in the media landscape that we live in today. Sure you can remember turning on the news and seeing some organized protest being painted in a light good or bad that it really didn\u2019t deserve...the people painting the picture...probably a vested interest in it being painted in that exact way. Consider also how common it is for campaigns of ANY variety to effectively side step the entire question at hand that has to do with specific policy...and turn the conversation into some sort of witch hunt against something...or fist pumping for something that\u2019s practically impossible to disagree with. Just as a point of reference here... let\u2019s take a look at some popular slogans from US presidential campaigns that the whole family can enjoy! Keep America Great. Now what citizen...voting in a US presidential election...could possibly disagree with that statement? You could disagree with the policy behind that campaign...but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here. You could disagree that america is great in the first place...but there\u2019s a sense in which you could re-read that to mean that we should KEEP America great and get away from the way things are now. Point is...to disagree with this statement is to be anti-American by default. So why even consider someone\u2019s opinion about who should be president if they DON\u2019T agree with it? In other words, Chomsky would say...the statement is utterly meaningless. The statement is so vacuous that it\u2019s really not saying ANYTHING of substance...but it\u2019s not trying to say anything of substance ANYWAY...the REAL point is to switch the conversation away from the real policy that lies underneath the slogan...much like corporations would do so that people WEREN\u2019T discussing what the laborers were actually striking against. Another example: Hope and Change. What human being can possible disagree with the idea of hope being a good thing? Like who sits around coming up with an argument for something like that anyway...no, I think we are better off if we all feel hopeless. Change...what person is against change in the face of social unrest and an economic downturn at the time that left people immiserated. Once again...the point is NOT actually to say anything of substance here...the point is to subvert substantive conversations about the policy going on behind the catchy, vacuous one liner that only a lunatic could disagree with. The statement is shallow BY DESIGN to get people to think the question of this election is as deep as a kiddy pool...when in reality it\u2019s more like the depth of the ocean. But a bewildered herd of cattle can\u2019t last very long in the ocean...or they\u2019d all drown. How about slogans like \u201cSupport our Troops\u201d? Not do you support the policies connected to the war in which they\u2019re fighting...do you support the troops? Well how can you NOT support the troops? To even start making that argument Chomsky says you have to START by saying, well I don\u2019t NOT support the troops and he says by that time you\u2019ve already lost. What if you heard the slogan peace and harmony somewhere? Now, on one hand how can anyone ever disagree with that...meanwhile Thanos might be handing out t-shirts and buttons. The point to Chomsky and Herman is this is one propaganda tactic that uses media to drastically limit the parameters of a discussion, which in turn effectively, manufactures the consent of the herd...hence the title manufacturing consent. But we can see how the whole thing is structured more clearly if we move away from things like presidential slogans and move more towards how consent is manufactured in the news media in particular. Because here\u2019s the thing if this is all true we HAVE to ask the question: are people like Wolf Blitzer self-censoring for the sake of pandering TO these people in positions of corporate, government and institutional power? Like is W-Blitz coming to work everyday...choosing news stories himself...CHOOSING them because of direction he\u2019s getting from some cabal of corporate overseers that he has secret back room meetings with? How about EVERY anchor, journalist, reporter, editor, columnist, blogger...are these people ALL getting an email in the morning from the monopoly guy telling them what to report on? The answer to Chomsky and Herman is no...the problem is much more insidious than that. Chomsky writes in his book media control:\u201cJournalists are not normally kept under control through top down intervention, but by journalists\u2019 internalization of priorities and definitions of news-worthiness that conform to the institutions policy.\u201dBut he actually says it even BETTER in an interview he did with a reporter in the 1970\u2019s...the reporter asks Chomsky do you really think that I am self-censoring right now? CLEARLY the reporter knowing that every day his ONLY intent when he does his job is to get to the bottom of what the truth is and NOT to peddle some narrative that\u2019s been given to him. Chomsky says back to him: I\u2019m not saying that you THINK you\u2019re self-censoring...I\u2019m sure you believe every word that you\u2019re saying. What I\u2019m saying is that if you believed something different...you wouldn\u2019t be sitting where you\u2019re sitting. What Chomsky was referencing here is the primary argument presented in the book Manufacturing Consent. The news media is FULL of people that do their jobs really well. They can be ethical, hard-working, have a true desire to deliver the best news they can...they can be ALL THESE THINGS, but they will ALWAYS be operating within parameters that have been preset for them by people in positions of corporate, government and institutional power that have an inordinate amount of control over media outlets and USE that control to limit the narrative so as to keep the herd distracted and voting their way. In keeping with the view of society articulated by Walter Lippmann we talked about earlier in the episode...there are certain messages we need reinforced to the herd, that keep society moving forward in the correct direction and not at the whims of what they see as a bunch of toddlers. Media is the delivery system for those messages, and when you control the framework the news is delivered in, then anyone that falls too far outside the norms put in place... either... never gets a job reporting the news in the first place or doesn\u2019t last very long\u2014 not unlike the public officials we were talking about before. Now the FIRST question you may have is how exactly are they accomplishing this? Seems pretty ambitious of them. Chomsky and Herman lay out five primary filters that our news media has to pass through before it ever gets to us and begins informing our views about what\u2019s going on in the world. The first one is what they call media ownership. Chomsky says in an interview: make no mistake...the word media is another word for company. These are NOT public servants...this ISN\u2019T St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s hospital...these media outlets are FOR PROFIT endeavors...and we should NEVER forget that fact. The same reason you\u2019d never go into a meeting with your boss and read them off all the reasons you\u2019re secretly horrible at your job...if there was some hard hitting story or interview a news outlet could potentially run that was going to go directly against the interests of the company at large and maybe put it out of business...why would anyone ever run that story? Now on the other hand...let\u2019s say you come across a story that strongly goes against the interests of one of your competitor stations...you might be more INCLINED to run that story than you ever would have otherwise been. This dynamic serves as a filter of the information we get to inform our world views. The second filter our media has to go through is advertising. Now you may think this is similar to the filter of media control, but part of what\u2019s being referenced here is that there is not just one, single customer that a media outlet has. They have YOU as a customer...but equally they have advertisers as a customer...and what do they SELL these advertisers? You. Audiences. So if it serves the interests to curate an audience that corresponds with the values of some specific brand of toilet paper for example...so be it. The third filter we need to consider is the massive influence held by what they call the media elite. This is an interesting one that\u2019s essentially saying that people in high levels of corporate, government or institutional power effectively DECIDE the STANDARD for what is news-worthy at all. Say there is some sort of large public relations scandal that the government has to deal with...well the government itself gets to appoint a spokesperson to give the official statement, journalists if they want a credible news story look to their sources on the inside of the government to try to get the scoop...in other words they are forced to maintain relationships with their sources on the inside if they ever want to get something newsworthy...and what happens if they don\u2019t play by the rules...if they leak a piece of information the source didn\u2019t want them to? Well now they\u2019re cut off and can\u2019t GET to the official statements. Their name isn\u2019t going to be on the list of reporters that are allowed into the next press briefing. Their reporting gets TOO critical of things and often times they become slandered as PEOPLE...eventually falling into obscurity or labeled as crazy. This is the fourth filter called Flack. Your job as a journalist is to get the news...and if you had to follow a specific set of parameters in order to get it...probably wouldn\u2019t deviate too far outside them because if you did you wouldn\u2019t be very good at your job. We\u2019ve been conditioned to think that we see some sort of person on the street interview, hearing random people\u2019s opinions about things and we think well that\u2019s interesting and all...but when are we going to get to hear the OFFICIAL statement...the one worth remembering...the NEWSWORTHY statement. When you are the SOURCE of newsworthy information...when you\u2019re the transnational corporation that controls a media outlet...when you have the power to push certain stories you like and not cover ones you don\u2019t like...when you determine who the resident expert is and can pick and choose which expert agrees with you...when you decide what is newsworthy you decide what journalists even have to look for in the first place. You decide who gets ACCESS to the news. You decide the lane reporters have to stay in. This is why otherwise totally ethical people who are good at their jobs could be participating in delivering information that manufactures the consent of the herd. Make no mistake, the people in this way are being treated like a bewildered herd...the word Corral is often used. We need to corral the herd by corralling public opinion...and this is often done by reporting the news through the filter of fear...fear of some common enemy out there. This is the fifth filter Chomsky and Herman lay out and it\u2019s a big part of the reason people continue to tune in to the news every day and are willing to listen to ads about dishwasher tablets. We need to keep people afraid of some common enemy...popular ones that have been cited: communists, terrorists, illegal immigrants...maybe even democrats or republicans...but in all these cases the message is exactly the same: you need to stay informed about what this group is up to or it could be the downfall of our society...tune in tomorrow to get the latest scoop about their evil plans. When we think of media as a plural form of the word medium. When we think of news media as a filter BETWEEN us and reality...instead of a group of public servants working tirelessly to tell us the objective TRUTH about what\u2019s going on...you can start to soften a bit...you can start to see that enemy that you FEAR that\u2019s destroying the world...really are just fellow human beings that have lived a different life than you, with their OWN fears, with their OWN desires to save the world their kids will one day have to live in...you can start to question the very foundations of what grounds our social epistemology, at all. Which will be the topic of episode two of this series. Coming soon.Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "On Media pt. 2 - Marshall McLuhan",
        "spoken_text": "So most of us live our lives not all that confused about the events of the world that are going on around us. I mean, why would you be, really? We watch the news, we stay informed, we read books...when something happens we got a pretty good idea of how the world works, we got a pretty good idea of human nature and how people are going to behave in reaction to that thing...we have a pretty good idea of what is possible to expect. But every once in a while, occasionally, something happens in the world that throws us for a loop. Something that challenges these ideas we have about how things work. This thing can seem so bizarre and unexpected that you can even start to wonder how any person could have EVER possibly seen it coming. This feeling can send someone into a bit of a crisis mode. Did I know as much as I thought I knew about people and the universe? How do you explain this thing that's happening...what does this mean for the world moving forward? This can be a pretty uncomfortable place to sit for very long...people naturally want to get BACK to that comfortable place of feeling like they CAN predict the future. So a common strategy when someone's IN this place is to go out and seek out someone who SAW this thing coming who can give them answers. Now, historically when enough people ADOPT this strategy it creates a vacuum for some answer person to emerge. This could be a public intellectual...this could be a charismatic orator...doesn't really matter it just needs to be someone who can provide people with some clarity about the present situation. They usually do this by making connections between things that are foreign to the way people are used to thinking about things...usually by evoking concepts from MULTIPLE different highly specialized disciplines and synthesizing them into something that just makes good sense to people.  Now this may sound like an incredible position to BE in as a thinker. But what I want to do at the start of the episode here today is to ask you to consider the fact...that this person...and many famous popular intellectuals that you no doubt can imagine from your OWN life...these people are, in a way, STUCK in purgatory. This is a purgatory between the popular thought of the public who makes their fame possible, and the highly specialized academic realm who scoffs when they evoke concepts from a field they haven't dedicated their life to, and clearly don't fully understand. This person who's trapped can easily start to feel a bit frustrated...because on one hand...going on Good Morning America and being the token \"smart person\" or resident expert on a subject just because you can give a good sound bite can be deeply unsatisfying...almost like your TRUE message isn't really being fully understood. But on the other hand having academics turn their nose up at your work because you're not entirely singular in your focus...it can seem like what you're doing is not being appreciated the way it should.  Near the end of his life this is likely how the person we're going to be talking about today would have felt: Marshall McLuhan. Media theorist. Social critic. He's the dad at Christmas that carves the turkey while everyone else eats. Now for anyone that is trying to make connections between seemingly unconnected things...for anyone trying to bring an idea down from the heavens and place it in the lives of people like me...a really useful thing to be good at is to have a strong command of the metaphor. Metaphors act as bridges between the unfamiliar and the familiar. So for someone trying to make sense of a world that no one really knows how to navigate...it's no wonder someone like Marshall McLuhan would've used them often...and it just so happens that in my opinion the best ENTRY point into his work is one of his favorite metaphors of all time...used it thousands of times throughout his life...the metaphor is an allusion to a short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled A Descent into the Maelstrom. He thinks a situation that the main character was in is a great metaphor for what it is often like to be someone living in the media and technological landscape we find ourselves in.  The short story begins with someone telling a short story. Edgar Allan Poe says it's going to be like story time inception up in here folks, welcome to the 1800's. There's a man and his two brothers and they're out fishing in the ocean. All of a sudden there is a horrible vortex that appears...pulling in water, moving, spiraling down into a black pit at the bottom of the ocean. Their ship gets caught in it. They're trapped and can't get out. They start spiraling down into the abyss. The main characters brothers aren't too lucky. One gets washed over into the waves...the other goes insane from all the chaos. The main character clings to the ship and begins his long descent downward. Now at this point he COULD just resign himself from trying, accept where ever the vortex wants to take him and try not to think about anything. But instead he pays attention to what's around him...he starts to STUDY the vortex. The details. The patterns. He notices some of the debris trapped with him in the spiral gets shot down into the blackness, some of it gets rocketed back up to the surface...and by studying the patterns he eventually times it, jumps off of the ship, grabs onto a barrel and is sent to the top of the ocean where he is safe.  Now if you haven't already guessed the person trapped in the vortex is a metaphor for the average person immersed in a media and technological landscape...and the vortex represents the powerful forces in play, forces we often don't even realize are effecting us in this landscape...by studying the details and the patterns of how these forces are at work in the world around us, we may be able to become aware of them, to understand them and maybe ride a barrel to the surface and eventually escape them.  But if we want to do this it's going to take an understanding of media and technology and their effects on the psyche's of individuals that McLuhan thinks just doesn't exist yet at the point he's starting to do his work. So he decides to make one. From there he wants to talk about the media and technology of HIS time, how things are changing, and how what lies in the future.... may actually be a retrieval of something western culture lost thousands of years ago. But let's take this step by step and the FIRST step...is to talk about his theory of media and technology. Now the very first thing that needs to be said is that throughout McLuhan's work the terms media and technology are sometimes used practically interchangeably. We're going to talk more about the distinction between the two later...but for the sake of this explanation OF his media theory he defines a medium at the beginning of his book Understanding Media as, \"any extension of ourselves\". This is alluding to probably the most important idea you gotta understand if you want to understand all the REST of Marshall McLuhan...and that is that any new technology that's invented or any new idea that we come up with is ultimately an extension of ourselves...an extension of our physical bodies...an extension of our consciousness...it is us extending something about ourselves further out there into world...the easiest way to explain what he means is just to give you a bunch of examples.  Telescopes...are an extension of your ability to see. Hearing aids...are an extension of your ability to hear. TV's...are extensions of your eyes AND ears...you can see things going on on the other side of the globe. The wheel...is an extension of your feet. Put a cart on four wheels and it's an extension of your arms and back being able to carry stuff. Phones are an extension of your voice. A knife is an extension of your fingernails and teeth. Point is in the beginning human beings didn't have ANY technology. They had their senses, their brains and the best ideas they could come up with on their own. But the INSTANT...that some creative human being came up with the idea of a hammer...and realized it was far more effective at breaking up rocks than slamming your forehead into them...life instantly changed in that moment...what it is to be a human being changed in that moment. All of a sudden we have this tool that performs this task we have to get done better than the physical bodies we were born into. We should pause here because this is a really important point that McLuhan would want to stress. See it's so common for us to see a hammer, a telescope, a computer and to think these are merely pieces of technology that give us more options to explore as human beings, more capabilities than we had before. Who doesn't want more options...these things are tools at our disposal. But McLuhan would say try not to only think about the fact that we make the tools...think about how much the tools make us as well.  Once that hammer is introduced, once the telescope is introduced or the computer, how about a brand new type of nuclear weapon...some piece of what it is to be a human being changes in that moment. You know it's funny McLuhan once compared people that introduce media and technology into the world to a person in a plane dropping bombs on the villages full of innocent people below. He said this because whenever someone introduces media or technology into the world there is a similar level of distance where they don't often HAVE to see the potential damage they're doing long after they're dead...and many people introducing media and technology into the world are truly thinking about not only the full extent of consequences for introducing this into the culture...but also what former technology this is going to make obsolete, so as to remove some other part of what it is to be a human being, what future technology this might lead to that will have consequences. His point is not that we should all become psychics...his point is that generally speaking we are extremely BAD at predicting the unintended consequences down the road of introducing a new idea or invention. The world is too complex and dynamic to be able to, and yet people DO IT...everyday. Like with this podcast for example.  So this is McLuhan's big point that grounds his media theory. Media and technology are always extensions of ourselves out there into the physical world...and the media and technology at our disposal has a drastic impact on not only what we think of as being a human being, but also our very perceptions...what we perceive at all. To illustrate how much of an impact the media and technology of our time have on our perceptions, to show how we don't just make the technology the technology equally makes us...McLuhan is going to turn to something that is pretty uncommon for people to THINK of as a technology...but to McLuhan it was something invented long ago that has had a drastic impact on the way people think about things...and that is, written language, and along with it...the phonetic alphabet.  The ability to take an idea that only exists in your head, pull out a piece of paper, visually represent that idea through symbols and convey it in a very linear way where one word follows the next in a proper format and syntax that other people can understand...this is just as much an invention that extends ourselves out into the world as a telescope is. Language, and written or printed language at that, allows us to EXTEND our inner consciousness out into the world. But this relatively new VISUAL form of language does so in a very unique way that allows ideas to have a level of autonomy they never had before. What I mean is: long ago for who knows how many thousands of years the primary means of communication or media was talking about things. We lived in villages or tribes, if somebody had an idea...they didn't write a book about it...they spoke about it. If somebody wanted wisdom from the past, they didn't go to the library...they asked someone more experienced than them and they would get stories and lessons passed on down through the generations through this oral tradition. But McLuhan thinks in the relatively recent past, just a few thousand years, we've been going through a stage of human development that has been centered around literacy. Just as when you introduce a technology like a computer into a culture... and it changes the entire way people perceive their reality...written language is an invention as well...and the thinking of a person within a culture, to McLuhan, is highly effected by the dominant means of communication WITHIN that culture. So what happens when the dominant means of communication transitions from a primarily spoken word tradition to one that is highly visual, symbolic, structured, ordered and linear? Well to McLuhan it's going to lead to what he sometimes called the \"Gutenberg way of perceiving\"...which is an allusion to the Gutenberg press, the printing press that revolutionized the alloy of metal that allowed for printed words to last on the page at a level that made mass dissemination of books to the general public possible. The Gutenberg way of perceiving is an over-indexed, overdeveloped tendency towards the visual, the structured, the linear. He says at one point this may be part of the reason historically we've had such a narrow, linear view of things like time or history or identity.  You ask people that question what would you rather be? Blind or deaf? And 99% of people say they'd rather be deaf...because our culture is so visual in terms of how it communicates. But how might that sample size change if a new media or technology was introduced that communicated primarily through audio? You know, McLuhan once said:  \"We don't know who discovered water but we know it wasn't a fish. A pervasive environment, a pervasive medium is always beyond perception.\" The big point to McLuhan is this: the messages that these media of written language are sending to us...go far beyond the actual content or subject matter of the thing that's being written about. There are latent messages being sent that as fish in the water we just don't perceive.  Let's give another example McLuhan loved of how when you shift this primary means of communication it shifts what is possible for people within the culture. So when you're living in the tribal culture and the oral tradition we talked about before...when it comes to introducing radical new ideas or scathing critiques of the current way things are being done...there's not much room for that. There's not much devil's advocate in a village...there's an understanding that if you open your mouth and give an opinion about something...there's at least SOME connection to that idea that's in your head and your beliefs and identity. There's very little room for someone to be an individual, rogue agent that just thinks the rest of the village is stupid. The reason for this is that ideas in the oral tradition are inherently connected to the person that uttered them. However...during the era of written and PRINTED word, McLuhan says, all of a sudden we have the ability...to put ideas down on a piece of paper, slap a pseudonym down as the author, and we have the unique position of allowing ideas to exist independently. You can't refute these ideas by getting rid of the author...they're still going to be there tomorrow on the pages of the book that's now being mass distributed. This period of literacy allows people a level of individuality that never could've EXISTED in one of these small villages. This is just one example of hundreds of how the media of written language changes the lives of the people living in the cultures it is prevalent in.  Now, McLuhan takes this one step further. He doesn't want to just stop with written language and the effects it has on people...he wants to examine ALL forms of media  that communicate ideas and the effects they have. Because yes, reading printed text in the newspaper is going to have ONE type of effect on your reality...but what if you don't read the newspaper? What if you watch TV? What if you listen to the radio or podcasts for your information? Keep in mind that it's not just information media...roads, airplanes, clothes, any extension of ourselves...these are all media as well...that to McLuhan send similar messages and contribute to our way of perceiving the world. But by the word message... he's not talking about the specific content of a podcast, for example, or the specific image that a particular outfit is setting off. Just like written language...where the message that's being sent goes far beyond whatever specific thing is being talked about at the time...it is far bigger than that...so too with things like TV's, podcasts, newspapers...and yes ALSO with things like roads airplanes and clothes. When Marshall McLuhan says his famous line at the beginning of Understanding Media when he says \"The medium is the message.\" Whenever we have a medium, any extension of ourselves...the message that it delivers is SO MUCH GREATER than just the immediate content we might be receiving...just like with written language...it's BIGGER than that...he describes the true MESSAGE of a medium as the change of \"scale or pace or pattern\" and then how those factors IMPACT life as a person within that culture. He's more concerned with the human experience or effect that using a medium is going to have than whatever MEANING the immediate content may have.  We've already seen an example of this with language...not too big of a leap for people to think the same thing is happening when they turn on the TV. But what if this extends to ALL media...even things like roads...or clothes. What would that mean for us? Marshall McLuhan breaks down media into two very broad categories. Hot forms of media and cool forms of media. Let's use examples of information media because it's going to be more straightforward in understanding his greater point. Keep in mind these are not hard and fast definitions. McLuhan is not trying to rigidly define terms...he's just trying to offer some basic guidelines of organization, which he realizes cannot work perfectly. Hot forms of media, McLuhan says, are generally low in audience participation. They provide people with a lot of information and data, he describes them as mechanical and uniform. It's very one way...one party is GIVING information and the audience is RECEIVING it...and that's pretty much it. Examples of this would be things like books, pictures, radio, podcasts that don't take callers and informational videos. Cool forms of media, on the contrary, require a good DEAL of audience participation. They generally give less information than hot forms of media...so it requires the audience to do what McLuhan calls \"filling in the gaps\" of the story. Examples would be something like a skype or zoom video discussion group where people can ask questions, storytelling...where many of the details need to be filled in by the listener and they can ask clarifying questions...call in shows, cartoons...phone conversations. Getting your information through these COOLER forms of media is far different from the experience you're going to have getting your information through hot forms of media.  So again the message, the effect for having used a medium or the experience that a person has within a culture is going to come down to the media that is predominantly used BY that culture. People living in cultures that favor cooler forms of media will have an entirely different experience than those living in cultures that favor hot ones. Now let's go back for a second to the different eras of communication. McLuhan would say notice how the village cultures and one's immersed in the oral tradition of communication leaned much more in the direction of cool forms of media. Much more of a group effort. Whereas the literate societies tend to lean towards individualism and hot forms of media. Once again, wouldn't be a surprise to McLuhan that when the types of media a particular society favors change...so to do the patterns of human life within those societies. Once again, yes, we make the tools. But the tools make us as well. What happens though...when the media and technology that is introduced changes society in such a dramatic way...that the people living within it have a hard time knowing how to navigate their lives. Remember the beginning of the episode...people generally feel like they can predict what is going to happen next and how people are going to respond to it...but what happens when an unexpected technology gets introduced and it changes things to such an extent that people go out seeking answers from people that saw this thing coming. Marshall McLuhan was that person for a lot of people during the dawn of what you could call the electric age. We have the age of spoken word in our villages, we have the age of literacy with Gutenberg...McLuhan was living during the development of TV's, telephones and other instant electronic communication, electric automation, widespread international travel, the list is endless and the point is that the world was quickly changing into something that didn't resemble the age of literacy in the slightest bit. The people on the front lines LIVING in this brave new world...didn't have a guidebook to help them adapt. They were the beneficiaries of an education given to them by people that wrote letters to each other...they were people that valued the ability to read because they knew it would be the primary means of communicating important ideas that they needed to know about. But as I've asked on this show before and I've gotten ZERO responses which makes me KNOW I'm right...who reads anymore...really? Clearly joking. The answer's me...eight hours a day. But there's actually a kernel of truth in that joke that touches on a strong belief of McLuhan. Marshall McLuhan believed that eventually, if left to play out long enough, people living in this new electric age would no longer value literacy. Being able to read in this new era was eventually going to be about as valuable as it was in the early tribal societies before written word existed. Now think about that. If written word is a technology...then it seems the electric age is introducing a NEW technology that makes that older technology obsolete...much like the invention of the automobile that made the buggy whip obsolete.  He describes exactly what that new medium is in this famous passage: \"Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extension of man\u2014the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society, much as we have already extended our senses and nerves by the various media. Whether the extension of consciousness, so long sought by advertisers for specific products, will be 'a good thing' is a question that admits of a wide solution.\" He actually says a LOT there. So if a telescope is an extension of your eyes...and a TV is an extension of your eyes and ears...then the best way to describe electric media to McLuhan is that it's an extension of our entire nervous system. This new world is practically indiscernible from the world we lived in during the age of literacy. You want to talk to somebody? You write them a letter. Month from now...getting a response to a basic conversation will be the HIGHLIGHT of your day. Age of electricity you just pick up the phone. Instant communication. These days you are constantly available on demand to any person that wants to talk to you, anywhere. Back in the age of literacy if you wanted to travel across the country...you buy a couple oxen and wagon axles and embark on a three month long journey where you have to decide whether or not to ford the river and hopefully not die of typhoid. Age of electricity you just buy a plane ticket and are in a new city in a few hours. Back in the age of literacy you could build a house, lock the doors, live as an individual with privacy locked away in a box. Age of electricity that's not possible and it's only going to get more difficult. In fact, Marshall McLuhan would want us to consider at this point just how many similarities there are between our present existence and the existence of the villagers immersed in the oral tradition of communication.  You want to talk to someone in a close-knit village? You can find them in about ten seconds. Same with the telephone. You have very little privacy in a small village. Becoming more the case for us every day. Your life is constantly on display in a village and everybody knows what's going on with you...we volunteer that information over social media. The parallels between the life of a villager and our present day lives wouldn't have been a surprise to McLuhan at all...in fact he predicted it. He believed that electric media would extend our nervous system, the final phase of the extension of man...he believed it would allow for communication at such a level and extend collective human consciousness at such a rate that we would eventually find ourselves in what he called a \"global village\".  To McLuhan...the age of literacy has been a great experiment, and an age that led to the development of human beings that has no doubt been beneficial. But in the scheme of human history and generations that are yet to come, the need for written language will never be as important to people as it was for these last few thousand years. Whether our new global village will be a good thing or not to McLuhan remains up in the air. There are times he is for it and times he is against it. But his goal wasn't really to be making value judgments about it anyway. His goal was to get people to think about what effects this new form of media was going to have on the lives and psyches of the people. That's it. Should also be said, no matter what you think about the global village it too, one day, will be over-indexed and overdeveloped and IT will come to an end as well.  Regardless of where you stand on McLuhan's media theory...he is responsible for an entire branch of contemporary media theory that honestly wouldn't exist if it weren't for him. Some say his ideas are nostalgic and old. Some say they were far ahead of their time and that the longer technology develops the more we'll see how many things he got right. For me, personally, I don't really care either way. The value of Marshall McLuhan to me...the true takeaway that I think he would've been most happy if someone got from his books and lectures...is that we should pay attention. Be aware of the things that are going on around you. Try to be aware of media and the effects it they're having on human affairs. Don't just cling to the ship and ride the vortex down into the blackness. Look at the details. Try to make connections. Try to find patterns. Because it's only by paying attention that we can EVER hope to step outside of the landscape we inherited at birth against our will. In the immortal words of Marshall McLuhan: \"a fish doesn't know what water is until it's been beached.\" Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "ep": "Episode #150",
        "title": "The Frankfurt School - Erich Fromm on Love",
        "spoken_text": "So Erich Fromm in his 1956 book The Art of Loving famously wrote this about love:\u201cLove is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.\u201d But what did he mean by that? See that\u2019s how I do this show. I ask YOU a question. I interview YOU. You can\u2019t answer...and then I answer the question. See I\u2019m going for a level of narcissism and self importance here that is TRULY legendary...but seriously, what did he mean by that? Well, I think the best entry point into understanding what he meant would be to look at the two most philosophically loaded concepts in that statement and that would be one, love. What did he mean by love? And two, What does he mean when he says the fundamental problem of human existence? To put it very simply...what Fromm is referencing when he says the fundamental problem of human existence...is separateness. Human beings are conscious beings...and that consciousness allows us to be aware of what he calls a type of \u201cexistential loneliness\u201d. We are aware that we are ultimately separate from every other human being that\u2019s out there. We are aware...that no matter how much of a support system we have...if the right confluence of events came to pass...we ultimately only have ourselves. And that self by the way...is consciously aware that it feels separate from the entire rest of the universe! We\u2019re aware that we are one tiny pixel in a universe that is so large it\u2019s difficult for our brains to fathom...we are blips on a time scale that is so large it seems impossible to even comprehend. This reality of the human condition, for Fromm, is a big reason why people often want to find a way to connect to something greater than themselves...to ALLEVIATE this separateness. By the way it should be said that for Fromm, as a member of the Frankfurt School, this is also going to come along with a pretty big critique of the way modern SOCIETY alienates us from each other. The example we gave on the last Frankfurt School series was about boxes...we live in this thing that looks like a box, away from everyone else. We drive to work in a box. We work sometimes in a cubicle...Root word cube which is actually a...just a box. How about the social boxes we exist in. Many more examples, but the point is: we are alone...and the worst part to Fromm is that we realize it. So again to combat this separateness from everything there are tons of strategies people have used all throughout history to try to connect to something greater than themselves. Religion, Philosophy sure, but really our desire to connect to a tribe in general is connected to this existential loneliness. The desire to become a great painter, or write a legendary novel or even make a mediocre philosophy podcast...ALL of this is just a desperate attempt...by me...to quell this feeling of separateness. But Fromm says in our modern societies how practical is it really for the average person to try to become a painter that is so good they live on beyond their lifetime? They gotta work! It\u2019s impossible...and the people realize that as well. So one of the most COMMON strategies people use is to try to harness various different instantiations of love. Very common one is for people to try to find romantic love...or a partner they don\u2019t have to feel so separate from. Finding romantic love becomes one of the most important things in the plans people make when starting out their lives. People want love so bad they watch movies and TV shows about it...they listen to SONGS about it. They read STORIES about it. To Eric Fromm it\u2019s as though the people are STARVED of love. And who in their right mind could blame ANYBODY for putting in so much effort trying to find it. I mean, who WANTS to die alone! No WONDER we work so hard, constantly honing our strategy to find love...or do we really?Fromm would probably want to preface this section by saying consider how many relationships fail and NOT for reasons where you\u2019re FORCED by circumstance to go your separate ways?Like if you\u2019re listening to this...and you\u2019re not CURRENTLY in love...then barring certain exceptions for MOST of us...EVERY SINGLE attempt you\u2019ve made at love has failed. Why should this be the case if we\u2019re supposedly putting in so much effort to have enduring love in our lives? The ANSWER for Fromm is that most of us are using a horrible strategy. And the SLOGAN for this strategy if there was one...is that to find love...if you\u2019re NOT in love...become more lovable. Go to the gym, advance your career, buy some cool clothes, learn to play the ukulele...that always works. But are these things that are going to increase your odds of finding love? Fromm thinks all you\u2019ve REALLY done here is turn yourself into a product to be consumed on what he calls the \u201cpersonality market\u201d. And HOW FITTING, to Fromm, that in our modern capitalist societies we would be so inclined to turn our love lives and the love lives of other people into commodities to be marketed, bought, sold and traded. You improve something about yourself you increase your value within the market. You look around at all the options, pick the best one you can get with your current stock price, and then you enter into a mutually beneficial transaction with this other person where you receive in return a rush of emotions and endorphins and feels and all of a sudden, in a fleeting moment you just realize...it HAS HAPPENED. I am in love. In other words, love is something that HAPPENS to you...we say things like I FELL in love. You become as lovable as you possible can...and then love finds YOU...you don\u2019t find IT! Haven\u2019t found it yet? Wait around for a while and it will find you! Finding love is a passive process for most people. But Eric Fromm would say this is a perfect example of something he would call a type of \u201cimmature love\u201d. Which is to say it\u2019s a type of narcissistic love. A transactional love where two ultimately needy people decide that they\u2019re going to set up an arrangement where each of them appease the insecurities and weaknesses of the other. Let\u2019s team up our egos. In other words the type of person that I would fall in love with would have GONE to the gym, would have ADVANCED their career, would have played the ukulele like Kermit the freakin frog. Finally I\u2019ve found someone who makes me feel this way. Love is a feeling. Love is a noun. Wait Kermit the Frog played the banjo, didn\u2019t he? Doesn\u2019t matter the point is: how many of you out there have ever felt like someone has only loved the IDEA of you, rather than you. Well Erich Fromm thinks in these kinds of transactional relationships the intensity of the infatuation with each other is often connected to just the intensity of loneliness the people had experienced before that. But this isn\u2019t love. This is what can you do for me and what can I do for you in return. In other words you have essentially turned the person you \u201clove\u201d into a product to be consumed that provides your ego with some tangible benefit...and in turn you have turned YOURSELF into a product that has a similar exchange value. So when we consider the rate at which relationships fail. When we consider how often things run their course, or people get bored of someone...Fromm would say: well if the two of you are essentially just consumable products of a similar value on the personality market...OF COURSE you\u2019re going to get bored of them when you see them in this way! Let me explain: say you got into board games and you go down to the store and you buy Monopoly. You go home, you play it, you love it. You play it again the next day...you do this week after week and you play it so much that the little shoe thing has been eroded down by the oils in your fingers. How long can this go on? How long until you get bored of Monopoly and want to go out and buy another game to play? How long until what you initially got out of Monopoly is no longer something you need anymore, or what you initially got from it you now get BETTER from something else like paddle boarding or something. This is a reality of our modern consumer lives...we buy things, we enjoy them for a while and then we get bored of them and either donate them to someone else or throw them in the trash. When we commodify our love lives and choose to love people in relation to what benefit they can provide for us...we essentially turn our partners into that game of Monopoly. This is why Fromm would say no WONDER so many relationships forged by this strategy fail. When you structure your love life around the ethos of you scratch my back I scratch yours...well have you ever had someone scratching your back...and then they scratch for too long? What at first was a very welcome service they were providing for you can become very annoying in a short period of time.What\u2019s interesting is that there\u2019s going to be strong parallels between the way Fromm sees this strategy of treating the people we love and his views on authoritarianism and how it flourishes within a society which we\u2019re actually going to be talking about next episode. For example, consider this quote from one of his other works:\u201cDomination springs from impotence and in turn reinforces it, for if an individual can force somebody else to serve him, his own need to be productive is increasingly paralyzed.\u201dNotice how this same idea could be applied to our strategies for love! See remember, all of these strategies to have LOVE in our life came out of the need to get RID of this existential loneliness.  So if we can get someone else to serve, if we can get somebody to make us feel LESS alone and LESS anxious...silence some of these insecurities about which weaknesses of ours our partner SHOULD be compensating for...then we can effectively not have to feel any of the negative feelings that might OTHERWISE get us to take action to do the work to improve ourselves. Fromm thinks the solution to all this is actually kind of ironic. We engage in this mutually beneficial transaction with another person to try to ESCAPE the feeling of being alone...when the SOLUTION to be able to actually love someone in a real capacity is to learn to BE alone. See whenever we fail, whenever a relationship ends, we often adjust our strategy for the future by saying...oh, well THIS time I\u2019m going to search even HARDER for the perfect person...I\u2019m going to work even HARDER to become more lovable. We spend so much time doing this and so LITTLE time questioning the very foundations of how we see love in the first place. Like, where\u2019d you get your ideas about what love is or how to find it anyway? Was it in a YouTube video or something...where\u2019d we get all these deeply rooted ideas about it...and if it IS something that is so important to us, why do we spend so little time REALLY trying to understand it?Fromm says that one of the big mistaken ideas people have about love is that it is a thing. But HE says love is not an object it is a faculty. Which put another way is to say that love is not a noun...love is a verb. Most people think their problem is not BEING loved...their REAL problem is their ability TO love.So knowing all this here\u2019s how Fromm describes how he sees the faculty of love: \u201cLove is a relatively rare phenomenon and its place is taken by a number of forms of pseudo love.\u201d Later he writes in reference to this idea that love is something that happens to you...or an emotion or a noun in any sense:\u201cLove is a passionate affirmation of an \u201cobject\u201d; it is not an \u201caffect\u201d but an active striving and inner relatedness, the aim of which is the happiness, growth, and freedom of its object. It is a readiness which, in principle, can turn to any person and object including ourselves.\u201dSo hearing this definition and understanding love as this \u201cactive striving\u201d that Fromm is talking about the question becomes: why do so many of us have such a hard time developing this ability? Well notice a key difference between the transactional model of love and Fromm\u2019s conception of love. Fromm\u2019s idea says NOTHING about even CONSIDERING what the other person can do for me. This leads him to one of the most important ideas in the entire book The Art of Loving...that you will never be able to love ANY one person...until you can love everyone. Because you will ALWAYS be picking and choosing the people you love in terms of what benefits they can provide to you...Fromm says this kind of love more resembles symbiotic attachment or enlarged egotism thaN anything that has to do with love...this also explains his point of why he says it\u2019s not UNTIL you can be alone that you can truly love...because it\u2019s only from that place of not having some needs checklist you\u2019re trying to complete that you can see people and things for who and what they are and not what they can do for you. Love is not something that happens to you. There doesn\u2019t need to be some external cue that CAUSES you to have love for someone. They don\u2019t have to look a certain way, they don\u2019t have to do something nice for you or compliment your shoes the right way or admire your career at a certain level...love...is a choice YOU make. It is active choice to shine love outward to everything and every one. Again, he says if you truly love someone you love them for who they are...not who you want them to be...otherwise you\u2019re just making them an extension of your own ego; your own desires and expectations. This is why love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to this feeling of separateness from everyone and everything. This is a connection that isn\u2019t reliant on any external factors...it\u2019s a connection to give to others that you choose yourself. And that\u2019s the thing: if you choose NOT to give love to others then you won\u2019t be seeing it anytime soon yourself...you know he has this really great line in The Art of Loving where he essentially says that if you\u2019re somebody that goes around your life and you\u2019re not interested in anything...then you\u2019re never going to find anything interesting. Well in the same way if you go around your life never projecting this love outward into the world...you\u2019re probably going to be living a pretty loveless existence. But Fromm would say as easy as this is to understand the shift in theory that is necessary for finding love...putting it into practice is much easier said than done. Love is a relatively rare phenomenon because it\u2019s very difficult to master and even MORE difficult to sustain. This is not a part time job. In fact, if Fromm had to give love a category to be a part of...he\u2019d have to say that love can best be described as an art. He says:\u201cThe first step to take is to become aware that love is an art, just as living is an art; if we want to learn how to love we must proceed in the same way we have to proceed if we want to learn any other art.\u201dWe\u2019ll talk in a minute about the specifics he gives for how to proceed from here, but it\u2019s important to understand why Fromm is going in this direction at all. Why, of all things, would he refer to love as an art?Here\u2019s what he\u2019s getting at: think of any person that dedicates themselves to an art, true masters of what they do. These are people that have given themselves over to this artistic process...people who have dedicated their lives so much to their craft...that they actually perceive the world in a different way than other people. An illustrator sees a park bench differently than someone just walking their dog in the park. A musician hears the noise on the subway different from someone sitting there on their way to work at a bank. To become a true master of an art requires an immersion that is with you 24/7...not just when you feel like doing it...it is so much part of the fabric of who you are that it has become inseperable from you. Now think of those people, for example, that tell people oh yeah, I\u2019m a writer...and they\u2019ve written three things in the last six months. Fromm would probably ask is that person really a writer just because they can write letters down on a piece of paper when it\u2019s convenient...or at moments when they feel particularly inspired? Who ISN\u2019T a writer at that point as long as they know the alphabet. Applied more generally, to call yourself an artist in ANY capacity has to run deeper, for Fromm, down into the very way you live your life. Art is a part of you and you of it...it\u2019s not something you just pull out of the closet when you have a little extra free time. Well so too with the art of love. Once again, love is a full time job. In many ways love is a promise, Fromm says. Otherwise how could you possibly vow to love someone forever? Love is not about searching harder and finding the right person...love is about improving a skill...so how do we achieve mastery of that skill? Well one interesting thing Fromm asks us to consider in this pursuit is that just like many other forms of art like we talked about before...modern society ALSO works against people pursuing a mastery of love. Why is this? Well, remember his definition of love! Love is an active striving for the growth and happiness of the loved person rooted in one's own capacity to love. We\u2019re supposed to immerse our lives IN this active striving...but what does modern society tell us to actively strive for? Fromm says success, prestige, money and power...ALL of which run contrary to this love process. So in a way...if you\u2019re EVER going to love in a truly artistic fashion...you are necessarily going to have to be counter-culture as well. So if the amount of effort and concentration and patience required to love well wasn\u2019t enough of a barrier for you...here\u2019s a cultural barrier we can tack on there as well. Nonetheless let\u2019s say you\u2019re not deterred by how difficult this is going to be and still want to pursue love as an art to alleviate this separateness. Fromm thinks the process of improving at loving is very similar to the process of improving at other forms of art. He talks about four main things you can focus on. Humility, courage, faith and discipline. So the first one is humility. One of the main things he\u2019s referencing here is that we need to try to avoid the siren songs of the ego. To become a truly great artist...you need to approach the process of growth with humility. Because if you sit there as though you already know exactly how to do things and project your own expectations or desires onto the craft...you\u2019re always going improve less quickly than you otherwise could...because you\u2019re not going to be open to all the lessons making themselves available. Well so too with love. We need to try to have objectivity about loving people. Because if you only choose to love people you already think are worthy of receiving it then you\u2019re already sabotaging yourself. The second one is courage. Getting better at ANYTHING is an uncomfortable process. You\u2019re faced with roadblocks, puzzles, hostility from others...but a necessary part of improving is to keep going THROUGH this discomfort with a bit of courage. Fromm says you\u2019re going to run into similar problems when trying to cultivate this capacity to love and you\u2019re going to need a similar level of courage. The third one is faith. To master a really difficult piece of music...you may have to sit down at the piano 1000 times, making mistake after mistake, no doubt frustrated at times because it seems impossible. But the people that stick with it and end up mastering the song are the people that had a sort of rational faith in the process...they didn\u2019t try to play it five times and just assume it was impossible, they accepted their failures with faith that it was going to be possible in the end. So too with the art of love. You are not always going to be great at nurturing the growth and happiness of every single person...but the ones who eventually GET there, Fromm thinks, will be the ones who had a level of faith. The last one is discipline. This one should be obvious by now. Love is NOT a passive process or something that happens to you. Love is something you do. You do it every single day. The same way you would practice any OTHER art every single day. Fromm says:\u201cThe capacity to love demands a state of intensity, awareness, enhanced vitality. Which can only be the result of a productive and active orientation in many other spheres of life.\u201dWhat is he talking about here? There I go interviewing myself again. What he\u2019s getting at is that love is ultimately about giving...and the thing you are giving to the other person is yourself...and no matter how much time you spend trying to develop yourself as an artist...the quality of that art can ONLY be guaranteed if you take care of yourself in many other areas of life. To give a simplistic example just imagine a musician who practices 16 hours a day but they never take a shower and they get some flesh eating bacteria that eats off both their hands! You can\u2019t play the saxophone with your feet, people. Let that be a metaphor for the fact that in order to be the best you can be as a practitioner of love as an art\u2026you need to love yourself first. Because part of loving your fellow humans and part of loving that special someone is loving yourself enough to be healthy enough to show up and put this theory into practice. Now I could drone on about airplanes and oxygen masks here but I would much rather leave you with it being written beautifully by someone about ten times smarter than I am: Eric Fromm, The Art of Loving\u201cLove of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love towards themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others. Love, in principle, is indivisible as far as the connection between objects and one\u2019s own self are concerned.\u201dThank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "The Frankfurt School - Erich Fromm on Freedom",
        "spoken_text": "So last episode a major through line when discussing The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm...was that love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the fundamental problem of human existence. The fundamental problem being...that we are separate from everything and everyone else. That we are alone. That we exist in a state of what he called \u201cexistential loneliness\u201d. But what some of you out there maybe did is you heard that diagnosis...you looked to your left saw people you cared about...looked to your right and saw people you cared about and turned back to Fromm and said look Erich Fromm...you\u2019re saying that every body is alone out there...and I understand what you\u2019re saying I think you have some good ideas but let\u2019s be real: you don\u2019t KNOW ME! You don\u2019t know how alone or not alone I am. The real question is why are you so insistent on convincing me that I\u2019m alone all the time? What Erich Fromm would say is that you are among the most independent and isolated human beings that have ever lived in human history...and what you can THANK for this reality...are the very modern set of social conditions that you were born into...that themselves only exist because of a long, multi-thousand year process of what he calls the individuation...of human beings. Something that will be a recurring theme throughout this episode is that sometimes there are parallels between the stages of development within our personal lives and the stages of development on a more macro level when it comes to the way citizens behave politically within a society. THIS is no exception. Fromm would liken the development of human beings from the Stone Age until now to the development of a child from a fetus into an adult. Also sometimes called the process of individuation...let\u2019s consider the metaphor of the child for a second. Think back to what it was like when you were a fetus. Now I don\u2019t know about you people, but I remember it being like a five star resort. You don\u2019t have to lift a FINGER, as a fetus! Everything is included. You can lay around all day. People feed you like people feed you grapes at a resort. You don\u2019t have to make any decisions; you don\u2019t have a CARE in the world as a fetus. But eventually you have to get born. You\u2019re not born capable of taking care of yourself...so you\u2019re still in a slightly less inclusive luxury resort. You have some more autonomy now, but you still eat what your parents tell you to eat and go where ever they tell you to go. Now this pattern continues. As the years go on you slowly can do more and more things for yourself and desire greater levels of freedom to be able to run your own experiments. The distance between you and this family unit that at one point you could\u2019ve never survived without...becomes greater. This goes on until you turn 18...and for your 18th birthday you get luggage as a birthday present. You move out, you\u2019re on your own, you find a place to live, you think about going somewhere and you pick up your phone to call your parents to tell them and you realize...in this moment...for the first time ever...you can go somewhere...and you no longer need to call and ask for their permission anymore. You can go where ever you want to. Now remember this moment of our hypothetical fetus all grown up into an autonomous adult. Let\u2019s talk about the parallels Erich Fromm draws to the development of humanity...and then we\u2019ll come back. So pre-civilization human beings did not see themselves as separate from nature. Why would they? Every aspect of their lives was dictated by nature. They didn\u2019t have any agonizing choices...they didn\u2019t have to make decisions about whether today they\u2019re going to study particle physics or botany...no, nature gave them everything that they ate and decided everything that they were going to do. They didn\u2019t have to think for themselves fully...of course they thought but the key point is that it was a reaction to things that were happening to them dictated by nature. We develop civilizations...little bit further away from nature but still greatly at its mercy almost like being born. We develop class systems...we believe in teleologies...people are born and they fall into a role and a set of actions within society that is GIVEN to them, almost like it\u2019s by their parents. The best part is that this role gives them security...it lets them be a piece of something greater than themselves. Fromm says think of someone that\u2019s part of the peasantry during the Middle Ages. You\u2019re born and you\u2019re GIVEN a family unit and a village and a profession you will inherit and a church you are a part of and tons of other things and like we\u2019ve talked about in former episodes while this doesn\u2019t really give you a lot of freedom of choice...at least you know exactly who you are. This process of individuation continues. Turning point, Fromm thinks is right around the Renaissance. We start to see ourselves as separate from nature...look at the art from around this time. Nature can now be painted onto a canvas and viewed purely for the sake of aesthetics. Little after that we have the Protestant reformation...the work of Martin Luther and John Calvin...there is a new set of theological interpretations that view human beings as individuals before God not REQUIRING the intermediary of the church and its authority. Capitalism starts to become the dominant economic approach...much more of a focus on the individual economically. Fromm says we\u2019re living in an age where so many of the former chains of the past have been removed...we exist in a period of economic liberalism, political democracy, religious autonomy, and individualism in personal life...and this long process accented by this recent past in Europe and American to fight...for this new level of freedom and individualism in people\u2019s lives...has led to a place where the citizen has become individuated. Metaphorically speaking for the first time citizens are choosing what they want to do, picking up the phone to dial their parents, and realizing they don\u2019t need to ask anyone permission anymore. Both the young adult from our example before and the citizen of modernity are in a similar place to Erich Fromm. They are free now. They are the person at the helm of the ship with a lot of different directions they can go. When you finally find yourself in this place...seems like things would have to feel really good for you. So why is the book by Erich Fromm that we\u2019re covering today called Escape From Freedom? Why would anybody want to escape from freedom? Freedom is one of those things...what person DOESN\u2019T want freedom...pretty commonly considered to be a universally good thing. Fromm makes the case that for both of our examples here today, this initial state of freedom that we\u2019re born into can be both a good or a bad thing\u2026.because on one hand...becoming an autonomous free individual certainly gives you a new level of independence, a new level of rationality because now you\u2019re making the decisions, a new level a responsibility for the things you decide to do...your parents aren\u2019t making the itinerary you have to follow anymore...you don\u2019t have the chains of a village or a profession or a particular church...and all this is great! But on the flip side what comes along with that is that now YOU are responsible. You know sometimes kids can\u2019t wait until they\u2019re a grown up so that they can make decisions for themselves...but once you\u2019re an adult what you realize is that sure, you can decide to eat a half gallon of ice cream at 9AM if you want...but you ALSO are the only one that has to deal with the consequences of that choice. You choose your own adventure now...but now you\u2019re RESPONSIBLE for the adventures you choose. To quote Kierkegaard anxiety is the dizziness of freedom...so no wonder...when you finally find yourself individuated and free...in this new place...you naturally feel more anxious about decision making than you did as a child. You feel more alone and isolated...because now you don\u2019t have a village or something greater than yourself you\u2019re attached to...you\u2019re an individual. For Fromm there is always this trade off going on between you having higher levels of freedom and lower levels of security. Having independence can mean both that you have greater levels of freedom and greater levels of isolation all at the same time. So this place that we find ourselves in whether in our personal lives as young adults or in the social conditions surrounding us...this place where we have more options than ever before in terms of freedom...this is a place that Fromm calls unbearable. Lot of people are MISERABLE in this place. This is not how a human being is supposed to live...and what\u2019s MISSING for Fromm is that while no doubt generations have FOUGHT for this freedom so valiantly over the years...they\u2019ve really only guaranteed one HALF of freedom for people...and WE as INDIVIDUALS are responsible for the other half. What this is referencing is the classic way of dividing freedom that we talked about in our episodes on Isaiah Berlin...Positive freedom and Negative freedom. Negative freedom is typically described as freedom from. Meaning...this is the type of freedom we experience when the chains and tethers imposed by external forces are removed from our lives, freedom FROM those things. We experience negative freedom when we\u2019re no longer under the rule of a totalitarian regime, we experience it when we get a new assistant manager that isn\u2019t taking their childhood out on us anymore...but most importantly for Fromm here we EXPERIENCED it...when we no longer were born into a world that CHAINED us to an economic role, a voiceless political position, obedience to the church, and a collective place within a village or family. We are living in a place of unprecedented levels of negative freedom. But Fromm thought all the negative freedom in the world was USELESS if you didn\u2019t combine it with a healthy dose of positive freedom...or what is typically called freedom to. You can cut off all the chains that are holding you down but if you have no where you want to go...then what\u2019s the point? To practice positive freedom is to connect to the world in a way that is spontaneous...meaning that it comes from within...not from any sort of external force...it is self chosen. To connect in ways that are a positive outlet for energy...to connect through things like love and productive work and using our freedom to help other people DO things based on their OWN self-chosen growth and happiness...the opposite of chaining people down like negative freedom is trying to alleviate. Think of the parallels to the way we often treat our partners from the episode we just did on love. But I think it\u2019s important to take a second here and really examine the importance of this connection when it comes to how we should be utilizing our freedom. We all find ourselves at some point in this place of on one hand being free from the chains of the past...but on the other hand totally independent, responsible for ourselves, isolated, anxious and lonely. And it\u2019s once we\u2019re IN this uncomfortable place, to Fromm, that we have to find a way to alleviate this isolation and RECONNECT with the world around us. You know Fromm explicitly says when we\u2019re in this place we have to find a way to \u201cconnect to the world without eliminating our individuality.\u201d How we reconnect to the world REALLY is an absolutely CRUCIAL pivot point in our lives AND in the discussion Erich Fromm is trying to have in this book. Once again: when we find ourselves independent, isolated and alone...how do we connect to people and things around us? To Fromm you have two choices. You can embrace freedom...or you can escape from freedom. To embrace freedom is to find a way to use this positive freedom, this freedom to, to once again in a spontaneous, self-chosen way to connect to the world willing the growth and happiness of yourself and others through love and productive work. To escape from freedom is to connect to the world through one of a number of different strategies...but all of which share the very same characteristic. They are a retreat...AWAY from freedom...back to the old chains of the past...back to the womb. This is a REVERSAL of the process of individuation. This is a SACRIFICE of our individualism, this is finding a new set of chains to voluntarily lock ourselves into so that we don\u2019t have to deal with the pressures of thinking for ourselves. This is a way of reconnecting to the world by giving up your freedom, reestablishing that security...and sacrificing your individuality. Before Erich Fromm ever wrote this book or arrived at this thesis...he was doing sociological research on the German people during the interwar years in the Weimar Republic. He asked people to answer a series of questions about their political beliefs. What he found was that around 10% of them had what he called \u201cauthoritarian leanings\u201d. 15% of them were democratically minded. And around 75% of them landed somewhere in the middle of the two. Now, later...decades later it would come out that the conventional wisdom at the time was that... let\u2019s say there is an authoritarian leader that tries to ascend to power and has the backing of that 10% of people...the 15% of democratically minded people would serve as the necessary political opposition to be able to fight back against the authoritarians. But what Fromm wondered is what if the 75% of people in the middle were unable to deal with these new social conditions they were living in and incapable of embracing freedom as a solution during a potential fascist takeover? Well we all know what happened. He wrote later about the contrast between the hundreds of years of FIGHTING for this negative freedom before and then its immediate reversal as soon as people had it. \u201cWe have been compelled to recognize that millions in Germany were as eager to surrender their freedom as their fathers were to fight for it. That instead of wanting freedom they sought for ways to escape from it.\u201dThe world saw Hitler ascend to power. People at first were confused as to why the German people could ever get behind a fascist leader the way they did. Something that was common at the time and something that is still common to this day when trying to explain political motivations...is to give too simplistic an explanation for why people supported an extreme candidate. For example, Fromm says at the time some people tried to give a PURELY political explanation for the rise of Hitler...I believe he says that THEY said that it was by sheer, brute political FORCE that the third reich came to power. Too simplistic. Some people tried to say it was purely the socioeconomic desperation of post war Germany, too simple...some people tried to offer PURELY psychological reasons...that the only way these people could\u2019ve possibly supported Hitler is if they were crazy, or brainwashed, or dumb, or evil. Too basic. Fromm would say that\u2019s not a good enough explanation, in fact, it\u2019s downright dangerous if you do this sort of thing. Because if you don\u2019t understand the true reasons behind why people supported a leader like that in the first place and you say, well they must\u2019ve just been dumb. You will never TRULY understand why people tried to escape from freedom in this way...and you\u2019ll never be able to prevent it from happening again in the future. So AS a psychoanalytic sociologist...naturally Fromm is going to try to describe people\u2019s motivations in terms of a MIXTURE between psychological and sociological factors. When people find themselves in this place that many German citizens found themselves in...newly individuated, in possession of negative freedom, but overwhelmed by the pressures of EMBRACING their positive freedom in a productive way... Fromm gives three primary ways that people will typically use to ESCAPE from freedom. One is Authoritarianism, Two is Destructiveness and Three is Automaton Conformity. We\u2019re going to talk about all three of them right now and Authoritarianism is up first. Now remember the central question to consider when we\u2019re in this isolated, uncomfortable place is how are we going to RECONNECT ourselves to the world. When Fromm says that someone escapes from freedom by adopting an attitude of authoritarianism...he is NOT just talking about the actual authoritarian leader that ascends to power. All of the people who SUPPORT an authoritarian power structure are equally authoritarian as well. Someone who uses this strategy reconnects themselves to the world through what Fromm calls a type of sadomasochism. Two words there: Sadism and Masochism. Sadism being the desire to control others...to dominate, exploit, or steal from others. Masochism being the desire to submit to some power and BE controlled or dominated. The authoritarian is Sadistic in the sense that they want to support an authoritarian setup so that other people and groups will be controlled, but they are MASOCHISTIC in the sense that they themselves want to SUBMIT to that authority as part of the process. Both of these are a direct sacrifice of their freedom and individuality. See as a Sadist...you cannot exist unless if you HAVE somebody else to control. You\u2019re no longer capable of being an individual at that point...and as a masochist...you cannot exist unless if there\u2019s someone out there to control or dominate you. But consider this: Freud said and Fromm agreed that you never really see sadism in a person without some type of masochism attached to it...and vice versa. He says Hitler was an EXTREME example of somebody who was sadistic...but he was ALWAYS masochistic towards his position within history and the ideas of fate and chance. People with this authoritarian mindset will often escape from freedom by looking around them and finding out where the power structures lie...they\u2019re VERY GOOD at searching out and finding where there is a concentration of power. Then masochistically they insinuate themselves INTO that power structure. Become one small PART of this power structure, something they see as bigger than themselves, compensating for their weaknesses as a scared individual...and then they will USE their position as a foot soldier of that authoritarian to then take out their sadistic tendencies on other people in the name of this thing they have submitted to. The point is this: in this state they are no LONGER individuals...they are no longer free...they have retreated back towards the womb, back to a set of social conditions that tell them how to live, what to think, who the enemy is and they spend their days limiting the freedom of others, creating chains for people. Notice this is the OPPOSITE of the people that EMBRACE freedom. They might spend their days finding ways to project love to others...striving for the growth and happiness of others...respectful of their OWN self-chosen, spontaneous ideas of how to use their freedom to. These people would nurture that in others. They might find ways to CONTRIBUTE to society in a positive way through productive work. Politically...they\u2019re not in the business of creating new chains for people to operate in\u2026 they\u2019re in the business of helping other people DO the things they want to DO...that they\u2019ve decided... without any coercion from the outside, so long as they don\u2019t HURT anybody. But the authoritarian is the ENEMY of this person...both interpersonally AND politically, Fromm says. People who embrace freedom are ALWAYS going to be hated by people who are actively trying to destroy it in others. We all know somebody that HAS this type of personality. Somebody that seeks out power so they can submit to it and then use their new position to sadistically control people around them. You\u2019ll see this person where ever there is a power structure to take a little piece of for themselves. They are drawn to power like podcasters are drawn to horrible guests, they can\u2019t help it. You\u2019ll see this in the government. You\u2019ll see this in police departments. You\u2019ll see this in mid level management at a chain of restaurants. See in a normal, healthy relationship, Fromm says, you strive for the integrity of the other person, you preserve the equality between the both of you and you strive for your mutual independence because it protects your individuality and freedom. But again if your goal is to sprint in the other direction from this individuality and freedom because it\u2019s so uncomfortable...the sadomasochist doesn\u2019t respect the integrity of themselves or others...they\u2019re either submitting or controlling...which also DIRECTLY goes against the idea that both people in a relationship are on equal footing...when everyone is equal then how do we find out who\u2019s in power to submit to...and you can\u2019t POSSIBLY be respecting mutual independence...because the sadomasochist is ALWAYS dependent on the other party for their existence...which again is ONLY made possible if you have somebody to control or somebody to submit to. Fromm calls this a symbiotic relationship...this is the answer to HOW they reconnect to other people. See if the world is a whale then these people become a really toxic barnacle living on the side. Yes, part of something bigger, but really not contributing much of anything. The second way that people escape from freedom is what Fromm calls destructiveness. Sometimes this person is just called the destroyer. So if the person that embraces freedom creates order in the world in an emergent way, NOT based on some rigid authoritarian system, but by the synthesis of the collective self chosen expressions of positive freedom by everyone...if this person is CREATING...then the opposite of this person is someone who is destroying life. When people are free...life takes on this quality of being emergent and unpredictable...there is a constant state of movement and change in how the world plays out. The authoritarian tries to control this unpredictability by imposing order from the outside...the destructive person tries to control it...by destroying life in various ways...they destroy the very thing that they can\u2019t control. They sacrifice their individuality...because the only way they can feel significant or in control or safe is if they are actively hurting someone else, destroying something, attacking someone or even killing someone. Fromm calls these people necrophiles. They fixate on death and destruction because if for no other reason at least it isn\u2019t the life and creation that makes them feel so insignificant and anxious. The interesting part ABOUT this particular escape from freedom is that they\u2019re STILL reconnecting with people in the world. Because in some sick way...by making it your mission to destroy people and the world around you...you still have more of a connection to things than you did when you were a free individual doing nothing. The last way to escape from freedom is what Fromm calls Automaton Conformity. Fromm says:\u201cModern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds, or lose it by transforming himself into a small cog in the machine, well fed and well clothed, yet not a free man but an automaton.\u201dSo if you\u2019re feeling the pressure of being an individual...a really good way to get rid of any semblance of individuality is just to conform to the way everyone else acts around you. Now, what Fromm would want us to consider about all THREE of these strategies, but something that\u2019s particularly prevalent in people that conform to the beliefs of the people around them...is that they often don\u2019t even realize WHY they are trying to escape from freedom in the first place and to THEM...they often don\u2019t even see themselves as conforming to anything. They think these beliefs are theirs...a set of values that they\u2019ve painstakingly created and come up with over the years. They lose any form of individuality because they blend into the crowd so much there\u2019s no telling where they end and the next person begins...if we\u2019re all the same\u2026then there\u2019s no ROOM for individuals. Fromm calls this type of thinking pseudo thinking, because you aren\u2019t really thinking for yourself...you\u2019re just believing and saying what other people have told you to believe or say. Fromm thought this strategy of automaton conformity was extremely effective even in modern democratic societies. Because that\u2019s the thing...common rebuttal to these ideas might be, hey I got a solution! I have a way to prevent people from creating new chains for people to live in and from imposing order externally...let\u2019s just have a democracy! Then EVERYONE gets to choose what happens. But Fromm would say BE CAREFUL! Democracy is NOT a guarantee that people are going to remain in possession of their freedom. People can be just as easily be controlled by advertisements as they can be by the sword, and the insidious part of this democratic automaton conformity is that most people that are participating are going to think everything that they believe was their idea. You can see how this work starts to compliment some of the OTHER ideas we\u2019ve covered that were important to the Frankfurt School as a whole. Whether you agree with everything Erich Fromm has said or not...I think one theme of this book he wants us to consider that is practically irrefutable is the idea that freedom...can sometimes make your life better...and sometimes make your life more complicated. Freedom is not a panacea or some ultimate virtue that is unquestionably good. There\u2019s a reason Sartre says that we are \u201ccondemned to be free\u201d. And when you\u2019re in this place...devoid of the chains of the past...trying decide where to go...maybe politically you don\u2019t know exactly which cause to support or where to best spend your time...maybe interpersonally you don\u2019t know how to treat people...maybe in your love life you have something you want to go for but there are so many options and you\u2019re scared about what might happen if you pick one and use some of that freedom to. Having your chains cut but not knowing what adventure to choose next can be a trap you stay in for your entire life. And, you can live in fear of all the bad things that might or might not happen...you can be lost in the finite, lost in the infinite until you\u2019re old and grey, but I think what Fromm would say...is that we should try to understand the tremendous gift that we`have, right now. A gift that the vast majority of human beings could never even aspire to. He\u2019d probably say that if you\u2019re not moving because you\u2019re worried about not using your freedom properly...maybe the best piece of advice to start with is this: There is only one meaning to life...and that is the act of living it.Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "The Frankfurt School - Walter Benjamin pt. 1",
        "spoken_text": "So Walter Benjamin is notorious for being one of the most elusive thinkers of the early twentieth century. His work is a combination of influences so varied it\u2019s almost funny...it\u2019s a mix of ideas so seemingly disconnected the act of connecting them is almost as impressive as the ideas themselves...he\u2019ll go from Kant, to Marx, to 19th century German Literary criticism, to Jewish mysticism\u2026he\u2019ll go all over the world... and needless to say what results from all this... is a very interesting critique of 20th century culture. The man\u2019s work is often referred to as difficult...sometimes people even go so far as to say it\u2019s downright incomprehensible. This is no doubt...part of the reason why there is such a lack of representation OF his work in the world... which is part of why I wanted to cover him here. Sometimes when reading Benjamin, he can say things that on the surface... seem to be completely irrational or completely counterintuitive, But I think the biggest barrier... in trying to understand what he\u2019s saying... is, in a weird way, understanding what he\u2019s trying to say\u2026but that said, I don\u2019t think you can just begin the discussion with Walter Benjamin\u2019s most famous work called Art in the age of Mechnical Reproduction, as some people do...I dont think you can just cannonball in to talking about his critique of modernity, as some have in the past. The Arcades Project. Phantasmagoria. The Crisis of the Novel. No, I think there are a few extremely important things we need to understand about Benjamins thought before we can even HOPE to start covering these more complex topics. And I want to start today...in true Benjamin fashion...by talking about something that is going to at first seem completely random, but will ultimately end up being a piece of a larger critique we\u2019ll excavate over the course of the series...and that is...by looking at one of his early essays called...\u201cThe Task of the Translator\u201d. So the title of the essay is actually really good if you wanted to describe what the essay\u2019s all about. When somebody is translating something from one language into another...what exactly is the job...of that translator? What is the task of the translator?Now, at first this may seem to some like a pretty strange question to ask. Translation...seems pretty straight forward...you have a text written in one language...you speak ANOTHER language...really seems as simple as just saying what they said in one language in another language and the end result will be that its readable to a whole other group of people that didn\u2019t have access before. Who wouldn\u2019t want that?But this is a work in the area of translation theory...and to people who think about translation a LOT... this would be a pretty oversimplified way of looking at the whole process that\u2019s going on when we translate something. There\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t just copy and paste entire texts into Google translate and call that a translation...because it\u2019s a blurry mess...because sentences will read in a way that doesn\u2019t make ANY sense...because there\u2019s often words or sayings in ONE language that there just isn\u2019t a word for in another language...because languages don\u2019t line up perfectly. There are thousands of different ways you could translate any single sentence...thousands of different sets of criteria you could use when determining what exactly the best way to do that is. And considering...that people often SWEAR by one translation of a work over others...they\u2019ll say things like THIS translation of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is the best one and all the others are a waste of time...these sorts of value judgments necessarily imply that there must be better ways to translate than others. This is part of what Walter Benjamin is interested in getting to the bottom of...and if you wanted to find out what the best way to translate something is...seems like a pretty good place to start would be to consider what the task of the translator is at all. Benjamin writes about a couple answers to this that are EXTREMELY common that he thinks are completely incorrect. The first one is that the task of the translator is to make the translation as accessible as possible for the reader in the new language. That when choosing between the thousands of ways you could translate a sentence...your job is to choose the one that expresses what is being said in the way that most EASILY allows people to get ahold of it. Walter Benjamin thinks this is wrong...and he begins making his case by underscoring the fact that if we want to find the task of the translator...we have to remember that the translator... is always doing their job...while interacting with what is ultimately a piece of artwork. When you are translating a book of poetry you are translating a work of art. When you translate a great novel...that is art. Even when you are translating a work of non-fiction was the author not poetically or artistically trying to weave together ideas into a tapestry that is undeniably art? So in KEEPING with this...when considering the task of the translator we need to consider the nature of art itself...and on this topic Benjamin says the following:\u201cNo poem is intended for the reader. No picture for the beholder. No symphony for the listener. In appreciation for a work of art or art form consideration of the receiver never proves fruitful.\u201d Now if this seems like a weird thing to say because of our unique position in 2021...give Benjamin some time here. He\u2019s making a point about the way art has typically been done historically...and what he\u2019s getting at is that we don\u2019t necessarily create works of art with the audience in mind...nor does a work of art NEED an audience to be considered a work of art. Like when you were 16 years old in your room writing poetry in your own blood about how the security guard at the mall is really mean to you...did you expect or even care if anyone read those poems? When you\u2019re singing in the shower...or doing some sort of interpretive dance completely alone in your room...are you doing those things because of all the people in the future that might hear or see it? No, says Benjamin, and that\u2019s because art is not about the audience...art at its CORE is the ultimate form of self expression. So if we\u2019re trying to translate the full MEANING BEHIND a work of art...the reader or beholder...shouldn\u2019t really matter at all. Okay...so let\u2019s not consider the reader...let\u2019s just consider the text. What is actually inside of this book that we\u2019re translating? In other words, the task of the translator is to engage in this purely technical exercise of taking the contents of one thing and dumping it over into another language as perfectly as possible. But Benjamin would ask is this REALLY all that translators are doing? Take this as an example...Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. Song about the war of 1812. Powerful song. Now imagine I take the sheet music...sit at home with an orchestra full of instruments...with enough time...playing all the notes exactly as they\u2019re written on the page...I might be able to produce a recording of the 1812 overture that is indistinguishable from the recording I\u2019m trying to emulate. But have I recreated the extent of the MEANING behind this work of art? Something I made in the year 2021 in my condo...cannot not POSSIBLY capture the meaning behind this work of art WHEN it was created, WHERE it was created, HOW it was conveyed...the point is: no matter how PERFECTLY you reproduce the raw DATA in a work of art, no matter how PERFECTLY you translate the contents of a text...there will always be something MORE you are missing when it comes to accessing the entirety of its meaning. Now this isn\u2019t an episode about translation theory...this is ultimately an episode about art...and it\u2019s these two major points about works of art that are gonna be massively useful for us when it comes to understanding the rest of this series. For anyone interested: the one sentence version of the task of the translator for Benjamin is that it\u2019s derived from the Tower of Babel, that in the beginning there was one language that is now many different fragmented languages and that the task is to build bridges between these different languages that share a certain kinship, always striving towards but never actually achieving that ideal of the unified language inthe beginning. So much more to it. Definitely recommend reading the essay if you\u2019re interested. But again, these takeaways about art from this essay are the things that are going to help us, again, understand what he\u2019s saying by understanding what he\u2019s trying to say. We\u2019ll reference back to them as we need them. Now another initially confusing thing we need to understand about Benjamin\u2019s thought...is why he would be so interested... in something as random... and oddly specific... as late 19th century German literary criticism. Why would this matter to him so much? Well in a letter to a friend Benjamin once claimed that during his time in Germany literary criticism was not a serious genre...and that if anyone ever wanted to SERIOUSLY have a future in it...they would essentially have to recreate the genre. One thing to note right off the bat is that when we hear the words \u201cliterary criticism\u201d...we are not just talking about criticism...of works of literature. Certainly literature is part of it...the literature of the time... affects the culture of the time. When you ask someone for examples of things that helped shape their experience of reality...often times they\u2019ll respond with some really powerful BOOKS that they\u2019ve read. But in the sense that books...are collections of symbols that denote a particular meaning. Couldn\u2019t you say that the world around you is JUST AS MUCH a collection of symbols that you are constantly reading that denote meanings as well? For example they tear down a building... and they put up one that uses new technology...new doors, new windows a whole new design, instead of a single story rambler with a back yard now we have a high rise apartment building. There\u2019s fences, there\u2019s a security shed, stop signs, there\u2019s even little trash cans for people to stockpile their dog\u2019s discarded waste. Does the introduction of this new building...this new technology...this new symbol that people are reading...does this in any way change...the experience of the people who read it? Does reading the world around us have an effect on us at the same level that reading a book does? Interesting question. One of the things Benjamin is interested in the most is how the introduction of technologies shapes the experience of people. One of the most famous examples that he WRITES about...is the technology of photography. For the sake of us listening to this in 2021 let\u2019s think of photography as any sort of photo depiction of reality, so it\u2019s not like video is something that\u2019s exempt from this discussion. What is the technological predecessor to the photograph? There were of course many minor inventions that can be seen as just trying to do what the photograph eventually did better than all of them. But the TRUE predecessor to the photograph when it comes to creating representations of reality...is the painting. If you wanted to look at a picture of a landscape...or a person...or even some noteworthy political event that took place like a final dinner of some sort, idk bad example. Point is if you wanted a visual representation of reality for the longest time the painting was all that you had to look at. Now, consider certain realities about the technology of the painting...they were produced one at a time, they needed to be done by somebody VERY skilled, they were expensive to produce, to see them for most of history you had to be in the exact same place that they were, and they were always produced through the lens of the interpretation of a particular artist. Someone didn\u2019t deliver a stack of paintings to your front doorstep every morning showing you what was going on around town...so for most of history your VISUAL understanding of what the world is and your place within it really came down to what you immediately SAW around you. Another thing to consider Benjamin says is that for the longest time because paintings were so expensive and time consuming to produce...it was only the rich and powerful, most of the time members of the aristocracy that could ever afford to have their likeness painted. Which means... for the common person for the longest time...they didn\u2019t have a right to own their own likeness. But along came the photograph and all of this started to change. Benjamin says it\u2019s no coincidence that the first photographs you see are all people taking pictures of themselves, their families, their loved ones. But as we all know there is a big difference between being face to face looking at someone...and seeing a picture of someone. There\u2019s some degree of loss that occurs. I mean there\u2019s a reason people find it far more satisfying to travel and see things than to just sit on Google images and look at pictures of landmarks. Once again there is some degree of loss there. Well what are we losing? Benjamin says that a good place to start looking is to consider the fact that as these people who were among the first to ever gaze into a camera lens to record their likeness...wonder if any of them ever noticed that the camera wasn\u2019t gazing back at them. What did he mean by that? Remember back in the Task of the Translator when we were talking about how the raw CONTENTS of a piece of artwork are not tantamount to the entire MEANING of that piece of artwork. In the example I recreated the 1812 overture...and no matter how perfectly I photographed that work by Tchaikovsky there would always be something missing between what we could call my photo depiction and the original work. Think of the difference between being in person, witnessing and experiencing the one and only Mona Lisa...and merely seeing a picture of it. We recognize SOMETHING has been lost in the photograph...Benjamin would say what we\u2019re noticing is missing...is what he calls the \u201caura\u201d of a moment or a piece of artwork. He describes the concept of aura here:\u201cA strange weave of space and time: the unique appearance or semblance of distance no matter how close it may be. While at rest on a summer\u2019s noon, to trace a range of mountains on the horizon, or a branch that throws its shadow on the observer, until the moment or the hour become part of their appearance\u2014 this is what it means to breathe the aura of those mountains or that branch.\u201d So I don\u2019t know if any of you feel the same way and I hope I\u2019m not sounding like a crazy person here but I\u2019m kind of a fan of the moon...you know as a celebrity in MY life. Like have you ever looked up at the moon on one of those nights where it almost doesn\u2019t even look real...in my opinion it can be one of the most beautiful things out there...and there have been with no exaggeration AT LEAST ten times in my life I\u2019ve been looking up at one of these incredible moons, almost like you can reach out and touch it and I pull out my phone and I take a picture and I\u2019m so excited and I go to the picture so I can send it to all the friends I don\u2019t have...and I look at it...and I\u2019m GLAD I don\u2019t have friends because it just looks like a tennis ball floating in the sky. There is no picture out there...that could POSSIBLY capture...the aesthetic experience of being present with that moon, in that moment in space and time. As Benjamin\u2019s describing with both the mountains and the branch in that passage, there is an immediacy to my experience of the moon, because we are subject and object co-existing at a particular moment in space and time, but on the other hand there is a distance between subject and object...and it\u2019s this distance that allows for the aesthetic experience not possible on my camera. What\u2019s true of my experience of the moon is true of works of art all throughout history...and this is something Benjamin calls the \u201caura\u201d of a work of art. This is why it feels so different to see a picture of the Mona Lisa as opposed to flying to Paris and seeing the one and only Mona Lisa. And this one and only quality has been important for experiencing art in the past...this unique experience that someone can only have if both the subject and object are existing at the same moment of space and time...but it should be said: as a technological intervention into the experience of people...this is EXACTLY what the photograph allows us not to need anymore! The whole selling point of the photograph is that we can visually capture reality and it CAN exist outside of space and time. If the aura of a moment or piece of artwork requires that distance to allow for the space needed to reflect on it aesthetically...then Benjamin would say we HAVE to consider the fact... that the key function of the photograph (or the video)...is to REDUCE that distance. Benjamin would say that during his time the world is entering into an age where visual representations of reality aren\u2019t limited to how many paintings you can produce...basically anyone with functioning hands can point a camera, take a picture of something and then mass distribute it to everyone. Yes, this decreases that distance...it demystifies reality...people can now take as many pictures of themselves as they want. But in the same way you\u2019d rather travel than see pictures of landmarks...this demystified reality comes with a degree of loss. Yeah, you don\u2019t have to fly all over the world anymore if you want to see the Mona Lisa...but with every silver lining comes a cloud...and the cloud here, to Walter Benjamin, is the destruction of the aesthetic experience of the past. Remember when we talked about German Literary criticism? And how he\u2019s interested in figuring out how technology that is introduced into people\u2019s lives changes people\u2019s senses and experience of the world? We are living in an age...where the technology that has been introduced...has made practically everything about our lives mass reproducible. This is why he\u2019s concerned with the dead genre of literary criticism in Germany...because he actually thinks that technology has changed the experience of people SO MUCH...that the critical tools that were used in the nineteenth century to analyze culture and the world, were so outdated that they didn\u2019t even work anymore. We have techonologied our way into a place... where we lack the tools necessary to even critique the world around us. It would be like trying to take a mortar and pestle and using it to grind up steel. The tools from a former era DONT WORK with our current technology and experience. We needed a new set of tools. In his words, someone needed to recreate the genre, and as we\u2019ll see throughout the series DOING this...will become a pretty considerable piece of his work. When taking a picture people gaze into the camera but the camera doesn\u2019t return their gaze...meaning there is NOT a subject and object co existing in a moment of space and time, meaning that the photograph, reducing that distance we talked about, demystifying reality...leads to the decline of the aura. Benjamin writes about it here:\u201cThe peeling away of the object\u2019s shell, the destruction of the aura, is the signature of a perception whose sense of the sameness of things has grown to the point where even the singular, the unique, is divested of its uniqueness by means of its reproduction.\u201dOnce again, there is a difference between flying to Paris and seeing the one and only Mona Lisa and seeing a picture of the Mona Lisa that has been mass produced by technology. Just as there is a difference between looking up and witnessing the moon and seeing the tennis ball in the sky on your phone. Not only the photograph, but the technology introduced during the age of the mechanical reproduction of things has, as Walter Benjamin beautifully puts, \u201cdivested the uniqueness\u201d of things. Consequentially what is happening is we are destroying the aura of ourselves, the world and works of art. More importantly we are changing the very definition of what a work of art is at all. Task of a translator: see we no longer need to CARE about mass producing merely the contents or raw data of a work of art...the destruction of the aura makes it so that now there\u2019s not even anything MISSING if something is mass produced, distributed and commodified. We have CHANGED the aesthetic experience altogether. We no longer need to CARE about CREATING art for the sake of the consumer on the other side...because art is no longer the ultimate form of self expression...I willfully sacrifice my OWN unique self in this era of reproducibility. Let me explain further. Whenever we take a selfie...we are essentially turning ourselves into a PICTURE of the Mona Lisa, rather than the real thing. We mass reproduce, distribute and commodify OURSELVES. We divest OURSELVES of our OWN uniqueness and instead make our likeness into one of an infinite number of copies. Tell me, if the intervention of technology like a BUILDING can change the experience of people and the way they see themselves...what might something like THIS do? What if the critical tools of the past were incapable of seeing it?This mass reproducibility of everything...including of our own likeness...divested of its uniqueness...Benjamin would say it is NOT a coincidence that this technology has corresponded with a rise in mass culture. Mass production, Mass transit, Mass distribution, Mass psychology, Mass consumption, Mass communication. But an important question Walter Benjamin would want to ask here, and something that is going to be really important once he creates this new method of criticism and starts looking at what the world has become\u2026once again fascinated by how the introduction of new technologies affect the experiences of people...with ALL of these new forms of communication available...what happens when you can turn on the TV or the radio, and you can see or hear crowds of people gathered at a political event, or a concert, or a sports game...what happens, when for the first time in human history...the masses...can come face to face with themselves?Thank you for listening.

        "spoken_text": "So something important to consider about Walter Benjamin that maybe isn\u2019t as much the case with a lot of other thinkers we\u2019ve covered on this show is that his work in many ways is just as relevant today as it was when he was writing it. Philosophers, obviously, always do their work within a particular historical context. This context often shades the questions they think are worth asking. So when they come up with ANSWERS to these pressing questions...as INTERESTING as their work is...as much PRACTICAL value you might be able to get from it if you study it...the world sometimes passes their work by in terms of relevance. The work of Walter Benjamin is not this way though...because as we talked about last time...one of the main things that concerned him was this relationship between technological innovations and the sensory experience and subjectivity of people. You change the technology that surrounds them you change the person. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today...so when he\u2019s giving examples he\u2019s going to be referencing things like film and radio and TV, probably all three things that are on their way OUT in our modern world. But the way he thought these affected the individual subject and the political subject can be just as easily applied to different technologies things like the internet, smartphones or self driving cars. When you consider the fact that new technology is introduced faster than it ever has been...and how much influence this technology has in mediating our entire relationship with reality to the point you can almost think of us as cybernetic...maybe the work of Walter Benjamin has never been more relevant than right now. To make the case for why I want to begin by doing my best impression of completely hacky content that\u2019s out there. And here I go: I want to tell you all a story today. We have to go all the way back...to the beginning. No, ironically it\u2019s a story about stories. Storytelling. But maybe a better way to think about it is that it\u2019s a story about the mythology of different points in history. The unverifiable stories that people feel connected to and use to help navigate their existence. Now it used to be that the stories and mythology were passed down generation after generation by story-tellers. These people had great memories, great performative abilities, and they would tell the stories sometimes to small crowds of people. Few important things to consider about this early age of storytelling though: one, these stories were received collectively. This was a group activity people were engaged in. Some might say team building. Another thing: these stories were told many times, sometimes to the same group of people. But an important point is that they were NOT reproducible. You could generally tell the same story, but it would not be an exact copy, there would be variations, different details, most of the time if you\u2019re a really good storyteller you base these adjustments on your audience. Point is the collective process in which people received their stories...MIRRORED the collective societies that the people were a part of. But as you know time went on, Gutenberg Press, socio-economic reality changed and Benjamin illustrates how at this point our stories, our mythology started to take form in print. We saw the rise of something called the novel. Now, reading a novel, in contrast to the oral tradition from before, is not a collective activity. People don\u2019t all gather around the same book and wait to turn the page until everyone\u2019s done. This is an individual, sitting down, reading a book. Benjamin says even the story lines of novels almost always are about an individual protagonist, conquering some sort of challenge. Not a coincidence that the novel becomes the most popular form of storytelling during the extremely individualistic, solitary lifestyle of the industrial middle class. One more important point about novels. When you have this sort of individual relationship with a story...what Benjamin thinks it starts to promote is a type of what he calls concentration or deliberation about the novel. This skill of concentration becomes an EXTREMELY important skill to have not only when gleaning wisdom from a story, but also when it comes to formulating your political viewpoints. You generally sit down, weigh all the options and deliberate until you can choose the one you like the most. But again, the world goes on...and during the time of Benjamin what he starts to see is the rise of mass forms of storytelling, mass forms of communication with the introduction of film and radio. Well we heard his thoughts on photography and how it can alter people\u2019s subjectivity...but when we introduce ANOTHER technology...the technology of moving images on a screen...how much of an effect is THAT going to have? Benjamin famously describes the cinema as a sort of training ground for the citizen of modernity. Let me explain what he means by this...when you go to the cinema...you are once again receiving a story or a mythology in a collective way. This isn\u2019t like the individual experience of the novel this is much more like the era of storytelling where you become part of an audience of observers and listeners. When you think of film as a work of art...there isn\u2019t ONE copy of Gone With the Wind where you need to fly across the world to see it...millions, BILLIONS of people can all view the same moving images at the same time if they wanted to. That is to say that film is LIKE the age of storytelling in that it\u2019s received collectively, but UNLIKE storytelling in that exact copies of the story are now mass reproducible. Wanna pause for just two seconds and say that a really important thing to remember here is that in this NEW age of the mass reproducibility of art...Benjamin thinks that this changes several key premises about art that the artist always has to have in the back of their minds now if they want to survive within a capitalist society...which in turn changes what art is altogether. So an example of this would be...within a capitalist society if you\u2019re going to mass reproduce a piece of your artwork... you always have to in some capacity consider profit as an end goal. Which in turn leads you to consider the greatest number of reproductions for the lowest cost. Which in turn...leads you to consider not just art for the sake of the merit of the art alone...now you have to consider what sort of art is going to be the most reproducible, distributable and sellable. When the relationship between the observer and the artist becomes filtered by making art into a commodity...there are real consequences for both parties and we\u2019re going to see these present themselves in this new era of moving pictures on a screen. But first a couple more things about the sensory experience of film this was important to Benjamin:Benjamin compares something like a painting to something like a film. When you look at a painting...the image is standing still...there is time to observe, concentrate, deliberate, to have that individual moment of aesthetic reflection. But with a film, the images and sounds are coming at you so rapidly...things are changing so quickly...there\u2019s never any point where you can have a reflective moment because by the time you start on one it\u2019s already moved on to a completely DIFFERENT set of moving pictures. The result of this is that the default state of subjectivity when you\u2019re consuming artful stories made up of moving images and sounds on a regular basis...but also when consuming many OTHER forms of art in this age of mechanical reproduction...the default state is for a person to absorb the art in a constant state of distraction. Two different modes of thought: we have concentration on one hand...and distraction on the other. Benjamin describes the difference between concentration and distraction here:Distraction and concentration form polar opposites which may be stated as follows: A man who concentrates before a work of art is absorbed by it. He enters into this work of art the way legend tells of the Chinese painter when he viewed his finished painting. In contrast, the distracted mass absorbs the work of art. This is most obvious with regard to buildings. Architecture has always represented the prototype of a work of art the reception of which is consummated by a collectivity in a state of distraction. The laws of its reception are most instructive.So again this is going to be a really important distinction that Benjamin makes about different ways to experience art: someone who concentrates on a work of art is absorbed by it...whereas a distracted mass of people ABSORB the work of art. So as a point of comparison think about someone experiencing art during the era of the novel ...when concentration and deliberation were really important modes of thought: A person sees a painting, for example. They stare at it. They dissect it. They\u2019re in a contemplative state where their entire aesthetic experience is rooted in a type of focus ON the painting. Benjamin says in this way they are ABSORBED by the work of art. But don\u2019t mistake him for being somebody that is saying that this is way better than being distracted all the time and that we need to return BACK to doing things this way. He actually talks at one point about how this art that requires us to be ABSORBED into it to have an aesthetic experience is kind of an aggressive move by the artist if you think about it. The artist is essentially holding the aesthetic experience hostage...they\u2019re basically saying that if you don\u2019t surrender to me your undivided attention and a million dollars in unmarked bills...you\u2019re not going to get ANYTHING from me. But in our modern world...with the new technology that has been introduced...concentration and deliberation have become outdated modes of thought. Being able to concentrate is just not as useful of a SKILL in the metropolitan societies we live in today...and this not only LEADS to the crisis of the novel as Benjamin puts it...you know, people are no longer able to relate as much to this TYPE of art to get their mythology...but it also leads to the strategy that is more USEFUL in today\u2019s world...which is of course to live your life in a constant state of distraction. Let me give an example of what he\u2019s talking about:Think of life in a modern metropolitan city. You are constantly being bombarded by fleeting images, sounds, smells, textures\u2026look, you may be walking down the street and you see a flashing ad on a screen for a bottle of shampoo...you\u2019re interrupted by the sound of a car horn honking...but then someone tries to hand you their mix tape because they\u2019re trying to get their music off the ground...then someone walks past you talking to themselves and you mistake them for talking to you...but then you pass a restaurant and smell the food and look at their logo to see the name, but then someone shoulder checks you because you\u2019re in the way. So on the off chance you\u2019re not a monk wearing an orange onesie all the time...for the average person...trying to concentrate or deliberate on the experience that you\u2019re having in modern metropolitan life not only would be overwhelming but downright impossible. The modern subject exists in a state of distraction because they have to or else they won\u2019t get anything done at all. Think of distraction by the way not ONLY as your visual senses being fragmented interrupted, your eyes moving from one thing to the next. Benjamin would say this is not the ONLY way we pay attention with our senses. He says you could JUST as easily BE in a state of distraction because you are constantly getting fleeting inputs across a multi-sensory landscape.This is important because he\u2019s going to say that during the era of the novel things were way over-indexed in terms of the visual components of things. Sight became this monolith of our experience. People would sit down in a quiet, calm place so they wouldn\u2019t get too distracted...so that they could concentrate on what they were reading. When you go into an art gallery...you probably don\u2019t expect to see a mud wrestling tournament going on in the lobby...and that\u2019s for good reason. Visual things are important...But there are things you just cannot communicate through the single sensory communication of writing that you can ONLY communicate in a multi-sensory way, as the storytellers of the past well understood. The constant sensory bombardment and lack of stillness of modern life REQUIRES a DIFFERENT mode of thought to be able to absorb it properly. Once again, the world no longer absorbs us into it...we absorb the world as members of the distracted masses...and film and videos...serve as the ultimate training ground... for someone who has to live immersed in this distracted reality while still needing to passively absorb meaning as they go about their life. So in the same way the salons and cafes in Europe earlier in history would train the political subject through reading, discussions and debates, the cinema becomes the training ground for the modern subject. This is what he\u2019s referencing when he talks about architecture which he ALSO considered a form of mass media. Sure, you could theoretically stop, look at a building, over-index on the visual and really take it in for the work of art that it is. But Benjamin points out we are NOT tourists! Because in our cities, when going about our daily lives, do we stop and view everything visually and start to freak out about it? Oh...this airport bathroom tile is so, so amazing guys you HAVE to see it! Come in here! Quick No, we don\u2019t. How could you possibly do that? You\u2019d be like Bob Ross with a smartphone...if Bob Ross never had anything to accomplish with his day. We couldn\u2019t possibly do that, which is why our aesthetic experience is realized in the mode of distraction, by absorbing bits and pieces through our use or perception of the world. Distracted masses of people within a capitalist society are not getting their mythology from deliberative concentration about things...they usually appropriate things based on habits that they form, usually without ever even realizing that they\u2019re FORMING those habits or why. He says:\u201cEven the distracted person can form habits. What is more, the ability to master certain tasks in a state of distraction first proves that their performance has become habitual. The sort of distraction that is provided by art represents a covert measure of the extent to which it has become possible to perform new tasks of apperception.\u201dBy living in a state of distraction, we appropriate the world in many cases based on the habits that we happen to form. One of the main ways we appropriate the world around us is by having a particular world view. Benjamin is clearly very concerned with these new possibilities of delivering what he saw as bourgeois ideology to the masses through the medium of moving pictures...most prevalent during his time, in the realm of the cinema. Don\u2019t get him wrong! Especially in comparison to his counterparts in the Frankfurt School he\u2019s actually very optimistic about this new technology and its ability to have emancipatory potential for the masses...he just doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s being used for the purpose. Again, you combine passive spectatorship with film and video\u2019s ability to promote a story or mythology that is in line with a particular political ideology...this is a far cry from the storyteller passing down wisdom from other generations...this is far from the novel from the age of concentration...this is a mass reproducible delivery system that keeps people distracted and absorbing a story that could at best pacify their discontent with their place within society...and at worst render people foot soldiers in the regime of a mass murderer. Not to mention when you combine all this with capitalism...you have to also consider the filter always present between the film and the spectators...that the film NEEDS to be funded by someone. And Benjamin wants us to always keep in mind...that the very people that serve to benefit from keeping the masses distracted, absorbing an ideology that keeps things the way they are...just happen to be the very people that have the capital resources to be able to pick and choose which films to fund at all...or videos to produce. All of this segues pretty well into his next big point: that the combination of this new sensory disposition of the subject, that we\u2019re distracted all the time, plus the new role of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, plus the introduction of new mass communication technologies...all of this creates a sort of fertile soil that seems to inevitably lead...to fascism. See art throughout history has typically been connected to some sort of religious underpinning or ceremony or tradition. Once again, the ROLE of art was NOT to be mass reproduced and sold. But now that it is...yet again Benjamin is going to say this comes with both some good and some bad. The good...is that now the MEANING of a work of art can take on any shape you want it to. Ultimately the distracted masses are the critics in this new world, so now so more than ever...what the art means to YOU...actually matters. But once again: every silver lining has a cloud...and the cloud here is that now art...in the sense that it can be appropriated in any way we want now and that it is now mass reproduced: art has moved from what Benjamin refers to as the cult work of art to the exhibitionist work of art. Art in our new world is created primarily to be displayed...and whenever you display a piece of artwork...that makes it take on the form of being intrinsically political. Put another way the technology being introduced during this time has made it possible to politicize and mass distribute art in a way that has never been done before. So if you\u2019re an aspiring fascist leader...this becomes an incredible weapon in your arsenal in this age of the distracted masses. Because back in the age of the novel...the political subject relied on concentration and deliberation to make their political decisions as well. They would find a good quiet place to think, consider all the options, deliberate about which the best one is, tell their local representative and then reflect on their decision. Benjamin thought we are no longer in the era of deliberative politics. More than that...representative democracy was in crisis and seemed like it was on its way out if for no other reason than how people in power are now able to communicate directly to the masses themselves. The relationship between the political subject and the president or ruler used to be mediated by representatives in a representative democracy. Now it is mediated by technology...as is our entire experience with reality and what\u2019s even going on in the world. The representatives still exist...they still show up to work and go to some parliamentary meetings...but to Benjamin these representatives have become spectators almost like the audience at a cinema. They are quickly becoming an obsolete part of the political process. In other words the decline of the Aura even extends to our political leaders...leaders can now put their voice on a radio or their face on a screen and directly communicate with masses of political subjects. Works of art, propaganda, films, radio programs, books, videos, songs...can now be mass reproduced and distributed TO those masses. These masses...through images on a screen...through photographs from above can now come face to face with themselves. They can see themselves as a collective subject. At this point identifying yourself as one of the masses becomes easy. Consider the fact that as the masses come face to face with themselves...as people see the masses depicted in a particular light...could those images be producing the subjectivity of the masses themselves? Now if this were true, which Benjamin thought it was...then the implications of that are that we are essentially just living in a completely mass produced existence. Not only all the obvious reproduction of material goods and art and basically every way you can express yourself as a supposed individual...but we\u2019re even now mass reproducing people. Benjamin at one point talks about how just think about the fact...that things like film and TV and video lend themselves so much to political theater...or political spectacle and propaganda. When you\u2019re shooting a video of any variety and you point a camera at a scene you want to capture...there is only ONE perspective from which that scene gets delivered in that way. Shot from another angle you would see all the cameras, the sound people, the strings attached to the performers that allow them to fly. You\u2019d see not the image that has been DESIGNED for you to see...but the world through a wider lens. Now imagine if there was a direct line of communication between the people in ultimate positions of power through an online medium that only allows you to get your point across in 280 characters. Just imagine a TWEET has to encapsulate your thoughts on a matter. What\u2019s funny is that people do it all the time essentially conceding to the point that there is zero nuance to whatever issue they\u2019re commenting on. Can you really communicate ANYTHING other than ideology in 280 characters? So doesn\u2019t the platform itself filter out nuanced points of view by default? When the only things that can ever get upvoted and shared are things you can write down on a fortune cookie...is that really the way we want people in positions of power to deliver messages to the political subject? Especially considering the distracted masses NEED easy to grasp messages to absorb anyway?Benjamin says this in one of his most famous passages:\u201cFascism attempts to organize the newly proletarianized masses while leaving intact the property relations which they strive to abolish. It sees its salvation in granting expression to the masses \u2014 but on no account granting them rights. The masses have a right to change property relations; fascism seeks to give them expression in keeping these relations unchanged.\u201dTechnology mediates everything that we do. Today we mostly exist in a digital ontology that we use to make sense of the physical ontology we actually live in. More so than ever one of Benjamin\u2019s greatest points starts to come abundantly clear: that as time goes on...the communicability of our experience seems to become more and more difficult for us. Now we\u2019re going to talk about this concept more, but in a very general sense it\u2019s interesting to think about one of Benjamin\u2019s examples here. He says that when soldiers went away in WW1 and came home...you\u2019d expect them to return with all sorts of stories about what their life had been like during the conflict. But he says what you typically see, because of the new, sometimes brutal technology that mediated their experience there...what you see are people that clearly have a lot to say, but have a really hard time communicating any of it. There\u2019s always a pause. There\u2019s always a searching for the right turn of phrase to put someone in their experience who wasn\u2019t there. Well what if the technology that progressively mediates the life of a civilian has a similar effect? How alienating would it be to have a host of experiences that you\u2019d like nothing more than to share with the people you love and care about...but that language and communication has atrophied to such an extent...that it will always be impossible for you to actually tell them about it. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "Pragmatism and Truth",
        "spoken_text": "So if you\u2019ve listened to this show before you probably know that the late 19th early 20th century marks a period in western thought where thinkers are grappling with a new set of problems surrounding the concept of certainty. Think about that...for thousands of years...picture the Athenian agora. Socrates wakes up every day...wraps a table cloth around himself, marches out into the middle of town and argues with people all day long trying to get just a little bit closer to certainty or truth. Descartes... toils away in solitude trying to figure out what we can know for certain...the only one left to tell about his findings was his good pal wilson the stove. Hegel creates one of the most elaborate systems EVER trying to get to the truth...and shortly after many thinkers started to become downright pessimistic about this entire pursuit...about every thinker so far when it comes to whether or not they\u2019re actually doing ANYTHING that is actually getting us any closer to certainty. And while these thinkers couldn\u2019t be certain that we weren\u2019t arriving at certainty, it certainly seemed that way. So what followed was a rigorous critique of the way things had typically been done...and several different paths forward emerged and we can delineate these different approaches to solving the problem into different groups. So one group of people...you could say they thought we just weren\u2019t trying hard enough...the problem wasn\u2019t that certainty is inaccessible...it was in our methodologies. Think the logical positivists...think many of the Phenomenologists...the problem lies in the TACTICS of the past not in the project itself. Another group of people went the other way...maybe we\u2019ll never be able to ultimately verify the integrity of our philosophy...but it is still undeniably useful or necessary. Sometimes people talk about these two groups RESPONDING to this issue as one of the major forks in the road at the beginning of what would become the continental and analytical divide in the 20th century. But a school of thought emerged when trying to find some sort of middle ground between these two different types of thinkers. Thinkers like Charles Sanders Peirce...William James...these guys and people like them would later go on to become known as the Pragmatists. But something interesting I want to consider here at the start is that we should ALL remember...is that none of these thinkers set out THINKING of themselves as pragmatists. To them, they were among, again, many other thinkers that were looking into this problem of certainty...they were all undergoing a radical critique of the past...they just arrived at a unique end point. Now to get to this end point here today...I want to put ourselves in the shoes of someone like Charles Sanders Peirce and to do that let\u2019s just establish for sake of the episode that we\u2019re continuing on from here with the assumption that maybe the ways of doing things in the past has been fundamentally flawed. Certainty is impossible to ever have access to. Now that we\u2019ve established terms a bit, let\u2019s think about it from the perspective of someone during this time\u2026.so IF certainty is impossible...then our concept of truth within human affairs cannot be directly connected to certainty. Yet... we say things are true and we say things are false all the time. One of the questions that would have concerned Peirce and William James would be if that is true...then what have we humans REALLY been up to for thousands of years? Well a couple things we do know. One, certainty has generally been the ideal to strive towards when it comes to the validity of an idea. We think we know things, new information emerges, and an idea is more \u201ctrue\u201d if it seems to correspond with reality in a more accurate way than the old idea. Philosophers have spent LIFETIMES creating ideas that can stake a claim to certainty. All throughout the history of thought you can see several times they think they did the job. So if you\u2019re Charles Peirce or William James and you\u2019re trying to figure out what we\u2019ve actually been up to...maybe a good place to start would be to look at a few of these attempts by thinkers where they thought they got it right. Because if you\u2019re a pragmatist you are highly skeptical of this imperative towards certainty altogether. Why is being CERTAIN about things so important anyway? Three big attempts at certainty they\u2019re going to reject are solipsism, the correspondence theory of truth, and foundationalism...and they\u2019re going to get to the bottom of the presuppositions we\u2019ve been making about truth that led to these mistakes in thought. So let\u2019s start with solipsism. The solipsism bumper sticker would read I think therefore I am. You know, the tradition of Descartes and John Locke. Remember Descartes\u2019 point when he says that...the only reason he\u2019s thinking about his individual consciousness at all is because he\u2019s trying to find SOMETHING we can be ABSOLUTELY certain about. He stakes a claim to certainty... by saying well the very fact that I\u2019m thinking means I must certainly be a thinking thing. Maybe we can\u2019t know ANYTHING else for certain outside of that...knowledge of the world may ALWAYS be fallible...but it is impossible to deny that I am having thoughts. Descartes of course built things he thought were certain on top of that, but we can see the machinery he\u2019s trying to use to GROUND knowledge of things in certainty. So it seemed like Descartes had done it. Certainty had been achieved and balance had been restored to the universe. But it didn\u2019t take long for thinkers to find flaws in his reasoning. And people like Peirce and James would be the beneficiaries of that critique. In fact, to them...not only had Descartes NOT arrived at certainty...he succeeded in getting many thinkers after him on this delusional QUEST for certainty completely over-indexed on the importance of the individual consciousness. First of all, they would say...we have NO reason to assume that anything I claim to know about my consciousness is any more reliable than my knowledge of the outside world. So if we can\u2019t ever have complete certainty about the outside world...we can\u2019t ever have certainty of the internal world. We are always INFERRING things about our individual consciousness...which is to say it is always inferential. One thing to make clear here is that the brain for someone like William James is FAR too complex to ever understand fully, let alone consciousness. How can we ever use it to stake a claim to certainty and still be responsible thinkers? So this led to another strategy by thinkers. They said, ok maybe it is true that consciousness is inferential...which means that we experience things and often infer things about them in order to make sense of them. We plug them into this inference framework that gives them meaning to us. Okay. What if as a SOLUTION to that we tried to just look at the raw, base experience before any sort of inference has been made at all? I mean if we are self aware of the fact that we are MAKING these inferences about things...then hypothetically couldn\u2019t we spot them when we see them? Lot of thinkers tried their hand at figuring out a way to do this, but when you\u2019re Peirce and James and you\u2019re looking for the presupposition that deceived all these people...it would be this belief...that they believed that we can actually gain access to some deep, fundamental level of experience that exists independent of these inferences of the mind perceiving them. But Peirce rejects this idea completely. See to him it is impossible to use thought to access an object... WITHOUT making these inferences. The inferences are the mediator...they are the necessary bridge between thought and objects in reality. In a way, for peirce...cognition itself REQUIRES inferences about objects to even get off the ground at all. So if you\u2019re really sitting around saying, \u201cIm gonna be a philosopher today and solve some problems of the universe, today...I\u2019m gonna get rid of human judgements...I\u2019m gonna create a system that just removes all judgments, inferences, relations, every cognitive faculty I have...and then im just gonna sit here in my front room naked and just let the photons wash over me\u2026\u201d if you really believe that Peirce might think...well he\u2019d probably think you need to get a new hobby...maybe quilting or something...but he\u2019d ALSO say that all you\u2019ve really succeeded in doing there is to create a new set of inferences. There is no essence to a thing if you\u2019re a pragmatist...to understand something is not to access some foundational essence rooted in the universe...to understand something is to know all of the ways that thing has consequences on behavior or human action. So here\u2019s the big point! Once again we evoke the concept of truth all the time and CLEARLY certainty is NOT what we\u2019re getting at...then what is the meaning of truth? What really makes something true or false? Pragmatists are going to lean heavily towards something called the \u201cconvergence theory of truth\u201d or the idea...that something is deemed to be true...because take any issue you want to know the truth or falsehood of...the truth is the conclusion that all the people looking into it will CONVERGE upon given enough time. The GROUP of people rationally trying to get rid of false ideas and converge upon true ones...THAT is the true determiner of what is true. This convergence of minds and inferences is ALL the we have to determine what we call truth..and more than that it\u2019s all we\u2019ve EVER had. We just THOUGHT we were trying to access certainty...but this is a social process. For Peirce the MEANING of your actions isn\u2019t located up in your brain somewhere, but in your public acts. Actions speak louder than thoughts I guess. So in this way truth is a tool, not some piece of reality that we\u2019re uncovering. For William James a true statement is going to be one where when you believe in it... or act as though it is true...there are good results. So for example say you believed that cars don\u2019t really exist. The truth about cars is that they are just figments of your imagination...hallucenations that can be ignored. For William James this is false...not because we ran an experiment that proves it to be otherwise beyond a shadow of a doubt...not because he began from some foundational place like descartes and built a system that proves it otherwise...but simply because when you actually play the tape out on that belief...the first time you test the truth of that and moonwalk into the middle of the intersection grandma beatrice is going to have a new hood ornament. And for William James turns out that hood ornament was wrong.This is why societies tend to gravitate towards trying to make decisions that move us AWAY from false ideas and towards true ones. The true ideas are determined by which ones are producing the most favorable outcomes...of COURSE we\u2019d gravitate towards them. See once again social action is the place where we find meaning. Not in some individual consciousness...again Descartes and Locke wanted to make that the foundation of where we can get to true statements...but to the early pragmatists that individual consciousness and all of the inferences it makes are social products. Meaning is to be understood through action. Now.This action is an important part of this whole scheme. See for James as we develop as people...we mature towards a greater and greater level of intentionality in our actions. Another way to put that would be to say at that lowest level of development...we\u2019re just a collection of instincts, but once again as we mature as people we develop increasingly powerful levels of free will. Free will is going to be an important concept for James...and what is even more interesting is how he thinks the way we THINK about free will will be largely shaded by our overall personality. So I believe on the episode we did on William James earlier in the podcast I talked briefly about his concept of categorizing people in terms of them being either healthy minded or sick souls. Wanted to go more in depth on that today...and while TALKING about these different ways of orienting yourself with the world...maybe notice the parallels to the two different ways philosophers oriented themselves in the continental analytic divide we referenced earlier.\nWhen talking about writers he read during his early life he describes it like this: \"One can but recognize in such writers as these the presence of a temperament organically weighted on the side of cheer and fatally forbidden to linger, as those of opposite temperament linger, over the darker aspects of the universe.\"People \u201cweighted on the side of cheer\u201d as he said are the \u201chealthy minded\u201d. He talks about these people at one point as though they were born with a bottle of champagne with their name on it. These are people that value \u201ccourage, hope, and trust...and a correlative contempt for doubt, fear, worry and all nervously precautionary states of mind.\u201d So basically they wouldn\u2019t like your boy steve. But the other approach is that of the \u201csick souls\u201d...and try not to infer any sort of negative connotation that comes with the word \u201csick\u201d as though william james is trying to say those people are weak, or flawed in any way. He thinks some of the greatest people ever have been of this \u201csick\u201d predisposition...it\u2019s not any worse than the healthy minded approach. He just uses the word \u201csick\u201d to denote a malaise that comes with an awareness of the evil present in the world...and an unwillingness to ignore it. The healthy minded person says well of course there is evil in the world...but im going to focus on, preserve and generate all the GOOD there is out there. Positive thinking. The sick soul says you can\u2019t just buy a self help book that tells you the power of positive thinking, ignore the very real twisting knife in the side of the world and feel good about yourself. The healthy minded say in a world where you can choose to focus on anything...why not focus on the good rather than ruminate on all the negative? The sick soul says in a world where you can focus on anything...the good will take care of itself...the issues that warrant our attention are the ones where there are problems for us to solve. James says:\"...we can see how great an antagonism may naturally arise between the healthy-minded way of viewing life and the way that takes all this experience of evil as something essential. To this latter way, the morbid-minded way, as we might call it, healthy-mindedness pure and simple seems unspeakably blind and shallow. To the healthy-minded way, on the other hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and diseased. With their grubbing in rat-holes instead of living in the light; with their manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every unwholesome kind of misery, there is something almost obscene about these children of wrath and cravers of a second birth...These two approaches clearly are not a binary opposition. They exist as poles on either side of a massive spectrum. People fall all over this spectrum but may tend to gravitate towards one side or the other. But the good news is that there\u2019s mobility across this spectrum. James says for anyone that finds themselves, say,\non the sick soul side of things and wants to change it about themselves...there is hope! He believed you definitely COULD change the way you orient yourself...the same way the positive thinker has to be vigilant and make sure they act with intentionality towards the optimistic, the idealistic, the monism of their life...or else they might find themselves slipping across the spectrum a bit...so too can the pessimist direct the intentions of their actions and change as well. \"[W]hat are we to say of this quarrel? It seems to me that we are bound to say that morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience, and that its survey is the one that overlaps. The method of averting one's attention from evil, and living simply in the light of good is splendid as long as it will work. It will work with many persons; it will work far more generally than most of us are ready to suppose; and within the sphere of its successful operation there is nothing to be said against it as a religious solution. But it breaks down impotently as soon as melancholy comes; and even though one be quite free from melancholy one's self, there is no doubt that healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil facts which it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key to life's significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth\u2026\u201dHis larger point overall here is that he\u2019s giving a Pragmatist take on the variety of ways people have religious experiences. To him, he\u2019s not just talking about major religions like Islam or Christianity...those are great and all...but what they are at their core are attempts at codifying a very real religious experience that human beings have in relation to whatever they think is divine...human beings have these religious experiences, these major religions are attempts at explaining this phenomenon...and to be clear...sure you could have that religious experience where you feel deeply connected next to an almighty creator, fine...but James wants to point out how you could JUST as easily have that experience about skateboarding...or the love of your life... And he thinks whether you look at these experiences through the healthy minded or sick soul lens will DRASTICALLY impact what sorts of religious interpretations you prefer. He says this towards the end of that same work, for the record it is The Varieties of Religious Experience 1902:\"The completest religions would therefore seem to be those in which the pessimistic elements are best developed. Buddhism, of course, and Christianity are the best known to us of these. They are essentially religions of deliverance: the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life.\"Now, think about the fact that BOTH of these different ways of orienting yourself with reality IMPLY the possibility of action. This instantly inspires a follow up conversation about free will and determinism. Where do the pragmatists generally land on that issue? Well it\u2019s complicated and varied, but James makes a REALLY interesting point in the conversation. Pragmatism, once again, generally is going to look for a middle path between the two options or some version of compatiblism. He says consider this: when you look at the entire history of the world...that history can be explained by BOTH determinism and free will. You could believe that through intentionality we have created our history...that trillions of decision points have interacted to create a confluence of events that has led to this moment. You could ALSO believe that a completely predictable, complex process of trillions of sensations has played out and that we are the marionettes doing the heavy lifting. Both theories can account for the past. BUT William James says...when looking into the future...your belief about whether you have free will or not is EVERYTHING. You ever hear someone that hears about determinism for the first time and their response is to get depressed and say, \u201coh well then I guess that means I don\u2019t have any control over my actions anyway! Guess I won\u2019t even try anymore about the things I\u2019m passionate about!!\u201d Well, first of all that\u2019s not at all what determinism is saying. Second of all William James is advocating for a belief in compatiblism...some middle ground between these extreme positions. In order to take action on anything...or responsibility for yourself in any way...you need to believe in at least a degree of free will or autonomy. Certainly helps moving into the future if you don\u2019t hold the belief that everything you do is out of your control...and if we can\u2019t have certainty ANYWAY about how things unfold...then pragmatically...it makes SENSE to believe in intentionality. Just think about that. Think of how our beliefs about what possibilities we have in life...when truth is connected to the ideas that yield favorable outcomes for us...think about how much believing that you have no control over anything...tied to the back of the cart by your hands being pulled in one direction...think of how much what we believe about free will determines the quality of our lives. Think about being in THAT place...believing you have no responsibility for your future actions is a FAVORABLE outcome for that person. Really makes you start to think...WHY is that such a favorable outcome to that person?The best way I\u2019ve heard it described was something like this: imagine you\u2019re being chased by a bear...you\u2019re running and you come to edge of a cliff where there\u2019s like a six foot gap between you and safety on the other side. You have to try to jump. Can you make the jump there? What william James is saying is that forget whether you can or can\u2019t...consider for a second...that if you believe the TRUTH is that you will NEVER make it...then you will never even TRY to jump and get eaten by the bear. But if you believe there\u2019s at least a possibility you CAN...and then you jump and the favorable outcome...the TRUTH...was that you actually CAN make the jump...consider this: the truth never could have been realized without you BELIEVING it was possible. In this way...in a world where the truth about things is often thought of as us uncovering something latent in the cosmos...inquiring about the way that things are...what we think is possible has a HUGE impact on what the truth ends up being. A scientist that believes a hypothesis is impossible will never run the experiment. And in the case of the person that believes it\u2019s out of their control on a deterministic roller coaster...imagine being a scientist that refuses to run an experiment and sees that as a favorable outcome. William James said that the first act of free will is to admit that your will is free. Thank you for listening. Talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "title": "Emil Cioran pt. 1 - Absurdity and Nothingness",
        "spoken_text": "So, I wanted to begin today by giving a bit of a disclaimer about the thinker we\u2019re about to cover. Emil Cioran\u2014born in Romania, 1911, most of the time categorized as one of the great existentialists of the 20th century. And as an existentialist, not a surprise he\u2019s not going to spend a lot of his time talking about things like metaphysics, building elaborate systems, talking about epistemology, aesthetics. No, in fact, even more so than other existentialists out there, he actually thought all these things were mostly a waste of time. What Cioran wants to talk about is existence, the human condition, more specifically, the dark, inconveniently ugly aspects of existence that society often tells us to sweep under the rug, but nonetheless you find yourself sitting there on the couch after work on a Tuesday in your front room and at some level you know that those things are still there, under the rug hidden, but always still present.Because of this, we have to talk about some pretty dark stuff this episode. Not a surprise, but his fascination with this protected class of dark topics is going to cause a lot of people to label him a pessimist. And he no doubt was in some respects. But the point of this disclaimer at the top of the show is to let you know that, yes, 95% of you are going to disagree with the way he thinks about the human condition. But just know that my ambition as someone trying to present his ideas is that by the end of this, hopefully what I can get across is that despite what might seem on the surface like a very dark, pessimistic outlook, beneath the surface, Emil Cioran might be one of the most optimistic thinkers I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of studying.I guess the best thing I can say to prime us for talking about Cioran\u2019s work is that it\u2019s far from depressing. You know, sometimes when you have a problem in life, you want somebody to come in and give you advice and fix the problem, so it\u2019ll go away. You want a philosopher like Plato to come in and give you an answer for how to live with more wisdom. But sometimes when you face problems that you just have to endure and deal with, problems that clearly aren\u2019t going away anytime soon, sometimes you don\u2019t want someone to fix it. Sometimes you just want someone to listen, someone who\u2019s been there before that can relate to you. That is, in my reading, the essence of Cioran\u2019s work. He makes you feel a little less alone in these inevitable darker aspects of the human condition, and he makes you feel if only for a minute that you don\u2019t have to hide them for the sake of being polite.Maybe the best way to give some perspective as to how unique of a thinker he is is to talk about a group that to history became known as the Gnostics. The basic idea is this: the world is flawed in a lot of different ways. In a religious context, this might be described in terms of the world certainly not being heaven or paradise, right? In philosophy, the world is but an earthly shadow of the world of forms. Tons of examples. You get what I mean. So, if the world being flawed is a common concept within human thought, different groups throughout history have tried to come up with theories as to why this would be the case. The Gnostics believed that the world is messed up in a lot of ways because it was created in a messed-up way.God, however you want to envision it, could have created the world however it wanted to. It chose to create a world where we have to, for example, consume life to live. It created a world where there are blizzards and volcanoes and hurricanes and everything else that causes hardship. It created a world where suffering is a crucial part of the process. It created a world with clamshell packaging. That\u2019s just\u2014only a malicious God would ever create clamshell packaging. And to the Gnostics, only a malicious God would create a world where we could recognize and be aware of the suffering required of existence all the time.Now, it\u2019s because of this suffering that the Gnostics would arrive at a position which is much more commonly thought of in today\u2019s language as anti-natalism, which in one pronounced form is practiced by refusing to have children or even practice making them out of an extreme aversion to knowingly bringing any more unnecessary suffering into this world. Now, enter Emil Ciaron for a second. He once said that we all flee the tragedy of our birth, the reality of being cast into an absurd, meaningless world against our will. But as if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, on top of all that, we are consciously aware of that reality. He said, \u201cBetter to be an animal than a man, an insect than an animal, a plant than an insect, and so on. Salvation? Whatever diminishes the kingdom of consciousness and compromises its supremacy.\u201dBut here\u2019s the thing. Ciaron would ultimately even reject the Gnostics and the anti-natalists for many reasons, but one of the more telling ones is the simple fact that they even tried to systematize their conclusions. He rejected previous attempts by philosophers to try to neatly package things together like that. He actually rejected a lot of ways people have been doing things. He even rejected traditional formats in literature. He wrote in fragments in his work in this aphoristic style that\u2019s impossible to nail down. To put it bluntly, I guess, as he often did, you don\u2019t have to have some codified, official description of reality to realize that we are failed projects as people. Humanity itself is a failed project. Pray to whatever God you want, but to Emil Ciaron, whoever or whatever that God is, one thing\u2019s for certain, it kind of messed up on this particular project.Now, from here, not going to be a shocker to many of you, but Ciaron arrives at the conclusion that maybe, ultimately, everything is meaningless. And starting our discussion from this place, here\u2019s the point he might make here to start. It\u2019s that when you consider the utter meaninglessness of life, the sheer absurdity of existence, the suffering endured on massive scales daily simply for the sake of subsistence, how can anyone say that this is a beautiful creation? Now, you could make the argument, oh, well, it\u2019s beautiful in its own flawed way. How can we pigeon-hole the definition of beauty like that? But his point is this, what omniscient, omnipotent deity makes this as an art project? I mean, to Ciaron, this is the equivalent of when a preschooler glues a macaroni smiley face to construction paper. And of course, he\u2019s not actually considering the possibility of there being a God responsible for all this. He\u2019s just laughing at the absurdity of it from that specific perspective, which he did a lot in his work, by the way.See, Ciaron thought that\u2014let\u2019s say you do believe in some creative force behind the universe. If you really were dedicated to whatever God you think is up there planning all this, you sometimes have to be prepared to live without all the promises and safeguards that your God has to offer you. And he says that when you take a second and just listen, when you take a second to stop groveling at God\u2019s feet asking for security, when you stop asking for answers, what you hear is what he calls the one true only reality: silence. What do we hear when we \u201clet ideas be declared void; beliefs, trifles; art a lie; and philosophy, a joke?\u201d When we stop trying to rationalize and make sense of the world around us with religions or philosophy or any other method, we instantly come into contact with the reality of the universe: silence.He said, \u201cFor animals, life is all there is; for man, life is a question mark. An irreversible question mark, for man has never found, nor will ever find, any answers. Life not only has no meaning; it can never have one.\u201d Now, to 95% of you out there, so far this may just sound like the ramblings of an angry dude that just doesn\u2019t have the depth of character to have found a way to connect with the universe or people yet. But the thing that makes Cioran so interesting is the direction he\u2019s going to take all this.Let me start here. Look, there are very real, tragic, painful elements of human existence that we all experience at some point in our lives. That is to say that there are things about life that just plain suck sometimes. Practically everyone listening to this at some point has experienced some level of despair, depression, melancholy, failure. We\u2019ve all made missteps in life that have cost us big opportunities. We\u2019ve all had our hearts broken. You name it. And yet, how interesting, Cioran would say, that all of these and many more fall into this sort of privileged class that we have of dark topics, a set of real experiences that we all seem to be having that we\u2019re not supposed to really talk about.For most, life consists of constantly curating an image where you aren\u2019t feeling any of these things. We\u2019re supposed to be smiling in every picture. We\u2019re supposed to be happy about exactly where we are in life and excited about our future. But this image many of us project is not the reality of our internal experience. There\u2019s a sense in which we\u2019re just supposed to keep certain feelings inside and not talk about them. Because when a friend comes up to us and they tell us that they\u2019re feeling depressed about the meaninglessness of life or when they say they\u2019re feeling despair about the lack of control they ultimately have over things, how interesting, Cioran would say, that we often meet that person with a look of concern. That\u2019s the default. We may try to fix them as though they\u2019re broken or something, broken for acknowledging reality on reality\u2019s terms.But Cioran would say, why does it have to be this way? His point isn\u2019t that we shouldn\u2019t try to help our friends if they\u2019re feeling bad. I mean, of course you should, if that\u2019s what you want to do. His point is more that these negative internal experiences are a part of the human condition sometimes. Shouldn\u2019t we be able to talk about reality? And why is it something that makes us so uncomfortable when people do? I mean, take any other aspect of reality. 1+1 = 2. When your first-grade teacher talked about that aspect of reality, were you sad? Were you concerned? Was that the forbidden equation or something? No, of course not. So, why these parts of experience in particular? Why the taboo?To Cioran, the answer is simply because talking about them makes us feel uncomfortable. This point that he makes reminds me a bit of Heidegger\u2019s point in his concept of being unto death. Heidegger makes the point that many people spend their lives doing anything they can to not consider the absolute, total reality that one day they\u2019re going to have to die. We even structure our societies around the denial of that reality. We hide death and disease and illness away in these cordoned-off, distant facilities so that we never have to really look at it: cemeteries, hospitals, retirement homes. And no matter how uncomfortable it may make us to acknowledge this reality every day, ultimately, if we lived with a constant awareness of death, our lives would be lived in a much higher resolution. Well, so too with Cioran. These darker moments of our experience make us extremely uncomfortable. And by not vocalizing the way we feel and by making people feel damaged or broken when they do, it helps us in our quest to do what most people do in this life in his eyes, to live in a constant state of denial.Now, although there are more, three primary strategies people use to try to get rid of these bad feelings. The first one is that through various methods they try to just reason these feelings away. This is probably the most common method that has been used historically. This could be a religion. This could be a philosopher and their ideas. This could be a self-help book. This could be one of those weekend motivational seminars where everyone suddenly thinks it\u2019s a good idea to jump around, wave their arms like one of those two people outside the carwash. I mean, to Cioran, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. This is anything where we come up with some sort of narrative that aims to get away from these feelings.By the way, this is one of the things that makes Cioran such an interesting philosopher. He doesn\u2019t even like philosophy. And he saw all of these attempts by thinkers to create these rationalizations for these feelings as a waste of time. This, no doubt, won\u2019t be a surprise to many of you. Knowing that he\u2019s doing his work in the early to mid-20th century, coming out of the Enlightenment, reason is not exactly everyone\u2019s go-to when it comes to solving the problems we face as people. I mean, conclusions about biology and psychology are being highly scrutinized as are many of the other sciences. Language and its instability is under attack. Relativism, nihilism, historicism\u2014these are becoming the primary ways we direct our morality, not something some dude happened to reason to in his basement one day.Cioran\u2019s point is that when you try to reason away these feelings of dread and melancholy about existence, all you are really doing is being intellectually dishonest. You don\u2019t like how uncomfortable these feelings are, so you try to find some rationalization about life that allows you to feel more optimistic. But what you are simultaneously doing there, he says, is chaining yourself to a doctrine of false hope about higher things. Now, again, at surface level, this may sound like he\u2019s trying to be a downer. And someone might come away from that point with an attitude like, \u201cWell, then, what\u2019s the point in doing anything?\u201d But at a deeper level, what Cioran is saying here is just think of how many possibilities are made impossible to you by chaining yourself to some optimism cult.When you don\u2019t have any chains and you accept the aimlessness of things, the flipside of that is that now you can go anywhere. When you accept the dangers of the Savanna, for example, you don\u2019t have to stay crammed inside of that armored car on the road watching things from a distance. But just like any great attraction that\u2019s worth seeing, it comes with a cost. And the cost of this type of existence is melancholy, dread, and all the rest of the feelings that come with intellectual honesty.The second way Cioran thinks we try to get rid of the feelings is to distract ourselves away from them. This is a really common one in today\u2019s day and age because we have so many tools that help us do it so effectively. Netflix, social media, video games, things that get you intoxicated, fantasy novels\u2014there\u2019s no shortage of things to distract you away from these feelings if that\u2019s what you choose to do. But Cioran would say that if you choose to ignore these feelings, you do so at your own peril. Because here\u2019s the thing, you can\u2019t be on a constant IV drip of Netflix your entire life. These feelings of dread and melancholy\u2014they\u2019re coming.And it doesn\u2019t matter how comfortable you\u2019ve been or how long it\u2019s been since you\u2019ve experienced failure or tragedy, life will eventually throw something your way. And when it does, do you want to be comfortable dealing with those feelings? Or do you want those muscles atrophied? Do you want to face something that\u2019s going to be a trying time, but you know you\u2019re going to get through it? Or do you want potential catastrophe? Yes, just like reasoning things away, distraction may work in the short term, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem and, ultimately, just serves to rob you at some other point with an experience.The third common way people get rid of these is to just accept them as reality. We see this in things like stoicism, obviously in many eastern traditions. The idea is that if we can just learn to accept that things are ultimately out of our control and be fine with it, then all those things, no matter how uncomfortable they are, will no longer have any power over us. Now, that sounds great in theory. But Cioran was pretty skeptical about this hypothetical person and how much they really accepted these things or whether this was just yet another way of creating a rationalization for the sake of disarming the power these feelings have over us.You know, he has a quote that man accepts death but not the hour of his death. I think part of what he\u2019s getting at there is, look, we can accept the fact that one day in the future a meteor the size of Canada is going to unexpectedly slam into earth and end life as we know it. We can go about our lives caring about all kinds of things, never worrying about that potential meteor because, honestly, if it comes, what could we have done anyway? And if it doesn\u2019t, then, hey, don\u2019t I look wise for never having worried about it? But good luck when you actually see a rock the size of Canada raining fire on everything you\u2019ve ever known and loved. Good luck having a look on your face like you\u2019re waiting in line for a sandwich.But let\u2019s set that aside for a second. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s just say that these people have learned to completely accept everything that is out of their control. Cioran would say, mere acceptance is not enough to be a functioning human being. In a universe that is meaningless and filled with absurdity, to have reasons to get off the couch and do anything beyond eating and sleeping, you necessarily need to evoke, as he says, moral, aesthetic, religious, social, and many more reasons for doing it. No doubt, even those who have acquired this level of acceptance have made what Cioran would see as intellectually dishonest leaps in other areas, educated by the moral, aesthetic, religious, and social.And here's where he\u2019s coming from. The main premise of Cioran\u2019s work is nothingness. He says, \u201cWhen all the current reasons\u2014moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on\u2014no longer guide one\u2019s life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life. I live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing.\u201dHere\u2019s what he means. Consider this for a second. Like we said before, reason can certainly pacify you. Reason can give you temporary relief from feelings of dread and melancholy. But another way of looking at that is to say that in doing so, you chain yourself to a doctrine and limit the possibilities you have in life. That\u2019s an alternative way of looking at the merits of reason. Well, couldn\u2019t we also say that a person that doesn\u2019t have a pacifier of reason or distraction or acceptance disarming these uncomfortable feelings\u2014couldn\u2019t we say that a person filled with this feeling of despair is in some way full of life in a way all the other ones aren\u2019t? I mean, if despair and melancholy are parts of life at times, then couldn\u2019t we say running from them seems to be a denial or a negation of life in some way?You know, it\u2019s from this place that I want to look at this claim that Cioran is a pessimist a little bit closer. From his perspective, he is faced with the same reality as everyone else\u2014the tragedy of our birth against our will into a universe that we quickly realize is meaningless and absurd. Now, most people at this point run in the other direction. Once again, they pacify\u2014reason, distraction, acceptance\u2014but from his perspective, none of these have actually solved the problem. The universe is still absurd, and no rationalization or distraction has changed that fact. So, from the perspective of most that use one of these tactics, yes, Cioran is going to look like an ultimate pessimist because he\u2019s being negative about their optimistic outlook. But from his perspective, he\u2019s not being pessimistic; he\u2019s just calling it how he sees it. And he certainly doesn\u2019t advocate sitting around, lamenting the fact that everything is meaningless and the world is absurd all the time.What makes him an interesting thinker is that his tactic is to steer into the absurdity, to run into the burning building that everyone else wants to run away from, to learn to love the world, which is pure absurdity, simply for the sake of itself and not for the sake of what meaning it can give to us\u2014to be able to connect with pure uselessness. Remember, as he said, to be able to love something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life. By steering into the absurdity and embracing it, we affirm life. By running from it in all sorts of creative ways, we negate it. Can we say that this embrace of the human condition\u2014both the dark and the light sides of it\u2014can we say that this is a type of optimism?But make no mistake, if you wanted to embark on a journey like this, it certainly isn\u2019t going to be easy. This is a lifestyle that without question will require you to accept these feelings of melancholy, dread, failure, loneliness, and all the rest. But by embracing the true absurdity of the world and the reality of the emotional variance of the human condition, your reward will be to have access to the limitless possibilities that lay before you.And we\u2019ll talk about it more on next episode, but Emil Cioran would go on to say that he\u2019s never had a friend who didn\u2019t get real and steer into the absurdity of things without a pacifier. And you can kind of see where he\u2019s coming from. When picking your friends or when trying to understand yourself, when trying to get to know anyone, do you want a super distracted person talking to you? No, how do you even get to know them? Do you want someone just parroting some book they read or rambling about what Nietzsche said on a topic? No, I\u2019d rather just hang out with Nietzsche, personally. Do you relate to someone who masquerades around as someone who has transcended all of us other feeble human beings and our feelings of sadness? See, it\u2019s only by contending with the true possibilities available to us that we have access to ourselves and to others.Cioran has a quote in his book On the Heights of Despair where he asks a question. He asks, \u201cWho is more unhappy? He who feels his own loneliness or he who feels the loneliness of the world?\u201d He\u2019s saying a few things in this quote, but one of them I think is a perfect way of thinking of what many see as a paradox that lies at the foundations of his work. See, on one hand, he\u2019s the thinker that\u2019s going to go there. He\u2019s the thinker that is dark enough to bring up the cosmic level of loneliness of the human species, a loneliness that everyone feels. But just by bringing it up, talking about it, unpacking it, making fun of it at times, agonizing over it, and ultimately not accepting it to somehow diffuse it of how it makes us uncomfortable, but by embracing it, steering into it\u2014when we do all these things, we feel less alone after reading his work because we feel not only that someone else is feeling the way we do sometimes on our worst days, but also that everyone is feeling this way sometimes. And that makes you feel like you\u2019re at least a part of something.Now, he does this with every one of these feelings that we talked about today. He steers into them. He\u2019s fascinated by the most dark and taboo things to talk about in so-called polite conversation. Two of his favorites, though, that he spent a lifetime absolutely fascinated with were the concepts of failure and suicide. His thoughts on failure are as interesting as they are hilarious. His favorite people in life were complete failures. He would revel in his own failures in life and thought they should be embraced. We\u2019ll talk about it way more next episode.Suicide, on the other hand, was a bit more of a complicated issue. I want next episode to be exciting, so I don\u2019t want to give too much away here. But what I will say is that Cioran did not think suicide was an answer to uncomfortable feelings. He himself did not commit suicide. In fact, it might be tempting to picture Cioran as some emo-looking dude at the corner of the bar\u2014\u201cCraft beer is meaningless!\u201d No, on the contrary, remember, his whole message is to embrace life, which to him is necessarily to embrace melancholy, dread, failure, etc. There are several people that write about meeting Cioran, and they make it very clear that he may have been one of the most jovial people they\u2019d ever met.To leave you something to think about and to foreshadow what we\u2019ll be making a case for next episode, I leave you today with this. \u201cThe fact that life has no meaning is a reason to live\u2014moreover, it\u2019s the only one.\u201dThank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"

        "spoken_text": "So what Cioran liked to do after he clocked out for the day...when his feet hurt, his back hurt, his eyes were tired...when he finally got home after a long day of navigating the sheer absurdity and meaninglessness of absolutely everything...what Cioran liked to do is sit down at his desk and just write. The result of this was certainly plenty of books, On the Heights of Despair, The trouble with being born, A short history of decay just to name a few. But one thing we have to clarify to be able to truly understand the man behind this work is that his intention in writing all of these things was never to give you answers. It was never to construct a narrative, never to write a story. He wasn\u2019t writing these as long form persuasive essays to try to get you to think the same way he does. In fact part of the beauty of Cioran as a writer is that he really doesn\u2019t care WHAT you think about his writing. He won tons of awards writing in French, not EVEN his first language...rejected almost every one of them. He didn\u2019t care. See, he was writing for a different reason on THIS day. Today, he was writing for a personal reason. Writing... to Cioran was something to be a practitioner of. Writing to him was the greatest form of therapy he ever came across in his life. Whenever he wrote something...the intent behind it was always first, to express something. Because, as he said, whenever you express something that you\u2019re feeling inside it instantly makes it far more bearable to live with. When you understand that THIS was ultimately his first priority...you can clearly see that writing to him wasn\u2019t about being in the New York Times...writing to him was a matter of life and death. It was a way that he could work through tragedy in life, insomnia (which he struggled with), it was a way to contend with the melancholy and dread we talked about last episode...writing a book was, as he said, \u201csuicide postponed\u201d. So knowing all this about the guy...not a surprise that the stuff he generally chooses to write about are going to be these taboo, dark feeling states that we\u2019re not allowed to talk about in polite society. Also makes sense that he would write in fragments...instead of following some cookie cutter plot arc with a beginning, middle and end...he\u2019s not building an argument for his way of seeing things piece by piece...he\u2019s just writing...and writing beautifully for the record...don\u2019t believe me just go to his page on wikiquote and spend half the day scrolling down reading all of the quotable one-liners he produced during his time here.\nBut an important thing to note is that because he\u2019s never limited by traditional literary formats it becomes a good news bad news situation for the reader. The bad news is if you\u2019re somebody foolish enough to try to nail him down and define him...it\u2019s impossible. I mean what kind of idiot would you have to be to try to make a podcast episode about this guy? But on the flip side it\u2019s GOOD news if you\u2019re looking for an unbridled exploration of the absurdity of existence. The best anyone can EVER do is break down his fragments into general themes...concepts that he visits and revisits over multiple works and always seems to have something new to say about them. Themes like melancholy, dread, depression, but more importantly the ones we\u2019re going to focus on today: failure and suicide. Now it should be said...even trying to deconstruct his thought into themes is a losing battle as well. He often completely contradicts himself in his work. Even within the same book sometimes he\u2019ll say one thing, and then something almost diametrically opposed to it a few pages later. We should all understand though that, once again, writing was ultimately therapeutic to Cioran...not instructive. When someone called him out for contradicting himself he\u2019d be like, who cares? That wasn\u2019t the point of the writing anyway. I wasn\u2019t on some crusade to indoctrinate you into a way of thinking about things. To Cioran... contradicting yourself is just part of being an honest person who is alive, learning, growing and participating in life, and maybe even an indicator that you\u2019re more tapped in to the true absurdity of reality. Following this general theme it won\u2019t come as a surprise that Cioran saw in his biggest failures... elements of beauty and success...and in his biggest successes, winning every award, widespread critical acclaim, he often found a way to see these things as failures. Because if we\u2019re just looking at the theme of failure that he\u2019s fascinated in when doing his work...what you might come away with after having READ his work is a completely different perspective about how you might interact with failure in your life. Failure is yet another example of one of these taboo subjects we talked about last episode that we\u2019re not supposed to bring up in polite conversation. Like if you were at a party...and you saw somebody that you hadn\u2019t seen in a long time but you knew they tried to open up a vape store recently and it failed miserably...how messed up would it be for you to lead the conversation with...hey so how\u2019d that vape store work out for you? You, uh, you selling a lot of mango flavored smoke these days? How\u2019s your vaping portfolio doing? No, you don\u2019t say that to someone...you\u2019re not supposed to ask people about their failures. It\u2019s rude. It\u2019s intrusive. We\u2019re supposed to only talk about nice things. But what Cioran would say is picture that exact same party...say it\u2019s a five year high school reunion. Who do you want to talk to more, really? The guy that married his highschool sweetheart, went to college for accounting or something and everything worked out exactly the way he planned when he wrote that note in your yearbook on the last day of school? Or... do you want to talk to the person that failed. Do you want to talk to someone that wanted to become an engineer...but it backfired...so they found themselves hopelessly in debt, and out of desperation they took a job at a meat packing plant in germany and...once again...they failed miserably at packing meat. Like they just couldn\u2019t find a way to get the bologna into the container. So out of further desperation they tried to become a yoga instructor...but here\u2019s the thing: they don\u2019t know anything about yoga! They just tell people to do cartwheels and dance around with ribbons and stuff...when you consider all that this person went through...at the end of the story...honestly, Cioran would ask...who is the better conversation? Who would you rather talk to at that party? The failure or the success? Tolstoy famously says in the opening line of Anna Karenina:\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\"Both Tolstoy and Cioran are touching on similar themes here. People that are successful generally aim for the same things related to security...and that outcome is usually very predictable. They all ultimately look like the same person. But when you fail...and fail spectacularly...sometimes it can be like an art project that took on a mind of its own. It can be chaos. There are so many more ways to fail than to succeed and to Cioran, failures are just far more interesting...and not to mention... funny. So why do we make such an effort to run from them, or not talk about them? What would happen, in theory, if instead of avoiding failure, we steered into it? How would that change the way we make decisions in our life?Some of you are probably thinking, hey I think I see where Cioran is going with all this. Similar to last episode when he recommended that instead of running from these inconvenient aspects of existence like dread or melancholy...instead of finding a clever rationalization that defuses the power these feelings have over us...Cioran recommends that we steer into them and embrace them. Because for all we know they are the most important part of the human experience...who are we to negate any of them? Well maybe... he\u2019s doing the same thing here with the concept of failure...and that what he\u2019s ultimately going to say is that we should embrace failure because it\u2019s only through failure that we end up growing as people. Well yes, that\u2019s PART of it. But more accurately it\u2019s a very small PIECE of what he\u2019s saying about failure. Failure, to Cioran, was something much bigger than something that can be relegated down into a self-help maxim like that...failure was something that pervaded what it is to even be human...something that runs so deep in our lives that you can almost see it at a metaphysical level...that is... if making metaphysical claims was REALLY something Cioran was interested in doing. See, his goal here wasn\u2019t to rationally explain the universe through the lens of failure...his goal was to get us out of this silly holding pattern we\u2019re stuck in where we can\u2019t talk about failure in polite society, and in doing so, miss out on just how important of a resource failure potentially is for us. So let\u2019s build his case from the ground up...at the level of metaphysics. Remember Cioran muses in a tongue in cheek way that the world is messed up because whatever amazing deity that\u2019s apparently responsible for all of it must have created it in a messed up way. God failed on this particular project. Humanity itself is a failed project. In other words, even before getting started on whatever projects we decide to embark on in life...we\u2019re already at best building on top of a foundation of failure. Failure is written into the equation. But consider this: even once we DO decide how to spend our time in this life...our relationship with failure is a very special one as the years go on...because failure has a special kind of omnipresence that other aspects of life just don\u2019t have. See, friends and loved ones may come and go. Successes and triumphs are temporary. But failure, to Cioran\u2026.failure sticks with you. Every failure is a scarlet letter that you carry around with you. People around you know about your past failures. They remember them. And while they may not say anything for the sake of being nice and going along with that societal taboo...your collection of failures is a companion that follows you no matter where you decide to move or how you decide to dress. So where Cioran might begin is by asking: since we know that our failures are a companion that is going to stick around with us...would you rather be friends with that companion? Or enemies? Do you want failure to be an embarrassing acquaintance that you have to dance around talking about in conversations? Or is it possible to make it a friend...that you\u2019re proud of...that you draw inspiration from...given that failure is SUCH an integral part of this whole process...how do we not run from it or rationalize our failures away with some story...but instead steer into it?To do so will require us to completely reframe the way we look at failure...and maybe the best place to start doing that is to consider just how much Cioran thinks failure is responsible for the entire trajectory of the human species. Let me start here. Whenever anyone makes any important decision in life they do so in consideration of failure. When you decide what relationships you want in your life...when a scientist decides what experiments to run...when a country decides their foreign policy...we all make these decisions doing our best to get to what we see as a successful outcome. But whenever you\u2019re aiming for success as a target...you\u2019re naturally trying to aim AWAY from potential failures along the way. So in this way...our level of comfort and familiarity around the concept of failure directly impacts any important decision we make in life...even on the level of nations and the global community. When failure is something that we can\u2019t talk about. When failure is something we avoid reflecting on, when we don\u2019t fully understand what we\u2019re trying to avoid and why we are never able to aim for success as effectively as we otherwise could. Having a close relationship with failure, ironically, is one of the best places to be if you want to succeed in anything. Because in a universe that is full of absurdity and devoid of meaning...a failure has the exact same exchange value as a success. Why would we throw out such a valuable resource at our disposal?Just like last episode, the answer to this question to Cioran is a simple and obvious one. Failing and recounting our failures makes us feel extremely uncomfortable. But in the interest of us reframing how we see failure on today\u2019s episode...something we have to get to the bottom of is what exactly IS so uncomfortable about acknowledging our failures? Well part of it... HAS to be that by acknowledging a failure you are also simultaneously acknowledging at least a minor lack of self-awareness. Written into every failure is a formula. You wanted to do something. You thought you were capable of doing it, you aimed for success, and then were smacked in the face by reality when you hit some limitation of your abilities that caused you to fail. Point is: you wanted to succeed. Doesn\u2019t feel good to be made aware that you\u2019re not good enough to do something. And it DEFINITELY doesn\u2019t feel good to be REMINDED of that fact or asked about it at a party. Cioran understands all this, but I think he\u2019d say hold on a second let me ask you something. Whenever you fail at something...what is it that you ALWAYS get from failure that you absolutely NEVER get from success? One thing failure NEVER fails to do...is to give us an honest picture of who we actually are. Cioran says it well here...failure is:\u201cAlways essential, reveals us to ourselves, permits us to see ourselves as God sees us; whereas success distances us from what is most inward in ourselves and indeed in everything.\u201dFor example, picture some middle aged dude that after work everyday drives down to the elementary school with his exercise headband on and takes on all the fourth graders in a friendly game of basketball. He\u2019s posting them up, ripping the ball away from them, blocking all their shots, trash talking...this dude is 183-0 in basketball games against elementary school kids. He\u2019s the best in the business. Well here\u2019s the thing...if Lebron James goes down to the exact SAME elementary school HE TOO would BE 183-0 against those kids. So if this was the only sample we had to go off of...how can anyone really know who the better basketball player is? How can the middle aged dude ever TRULY know how good he is at basketball until he dares to challenge himself enough to fail and SEE where his limitations are? Failure in this way is one of the best friends you could ever possibly have. Failure is the gateway to truly knowing who you are...not just whatever story you have up in your head about who you are. You may be 183-0 in life because you\u2019ve never actually challenged yourself. Lot of people out there that think really highly of their abilities with perfect batting averages that are pretty lost when it comes to where to go on the map of life. But really, even if you have the best compass in the world...how can you ever know how to get to where you want to go on the map if you don\u2019t even know where you\u2019re starting from? Cioran once said that it\u2019s only:\u201cIn failure, in the greatness of a catastrophe that you can know someone.\u201dTo Cioran, failure has a unique ability to show you EXACTLY where you are right now in a way success just can\u2019t do. Cioran once said that he wanted to have a \u201cexistence constantly transfigured by failure.\u201d Transfigured meaning to transform into something more beautiful or elevated. See, he truly saw failure in this positive light. Failure is a voice of reason that keeps us honest about who we really are. He said he actually AIMED towards failure throughout his life, and he wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. Because to be able to look back at a life that was frequently punctuated by failure says a lot about a person. Not... that they were a failure as some people might conclude...I mean, to Cioran of course they were failures...we are ALL failures. No, someone who lived a life with a lot of failures also lived a life where they were courageous enough to push themselves and go for it. They misjudged their abilities and aimed too high at times, sure...but at least they DID something. Worse than being a failure, to Cioran, is to be someone so terrified of failure that you sit around and never do anything with your life. Sadly though, this is where a lot of people end up. People develop a relationship with failure like it is a schoolyard bully. They live in fear of it. Avoid it at all costs. Go out of their way to make sure they never cross paths with it. When they finally have to face it they see the entire interaction as a negative, painful experience. They\u2019re embarrassed to talk about it and so they never do. Remember to Cioran...being able to express something makes it a little more bearable to deal with. These people don\u2019t even have THAT as an option when it comes to their failures. They\u2019re left to pretend and act as though their failures and this bully doesn\u2019t even exist.But just like last episode with melancholy and dread...Cioran is going to ask: Why does it have to be this way? What if we embraced failure...steered into it? Saw it as beautiful, unique and interesting as Cioran did? Imagine never being scared of failing at anything...Not because you\u2019re dumb or something but because you saw failure as the only way to truly see how far you\u2019ve come since the LAST time you failed. You saw failure as an opportunity to get a one on one personalized lesson for how to adjust your strategy for success next time. You saw failure not as something to avoid, but some of the only evidence that you\u2019re actually living a life where you\u2019re not just playing fourth graders in basketball all day long. Cioran deeply admired people who were failures. Sometimes calling them outright losers. Aside from the fact he thought stories of failure were far more interesting and beautiful than stories of successs\u2026he genuinely admired people who lived lives that resembled failure\u2026because who else other than people who choose everyday to wake up and they just decide to be a failure\u2026who more than that person is really embodying how meaningless and absurd existence is? Cioran grew up in Romania...and at the time he saw his country as a prime example of absolute failure on the world\u2019s stage. So when he left Romania to go to school in Bucharest he had a keen eye for people who he thought were complete failures...and he gravitated towards them...endlessly fascinated by their lives. He said:\u201cIn Bucharest I met lots of people, many interesting people, especially losers, who would show up at the cafe talking endlessly and doing nothing. I have to say that, for me, these were the most interesting people there. People who did nothing all their lives, but who otherwise were brilliant.\u201dTo Cioran, failure was, if nothing else, way more interesting than success. Every failure is like a runaway art project...and every person embodying failure was a painting that required explanation from the artist. Cioran embraced failure so much...that he even lived his life RESEMBLING a failure even though he was far from it in actuality. He once said, \u201cthe big success of my life is that I\u2019ve managed to live without having a job.\u201d He also said, \u201cI preferred to live like a parasite rather than to destroy myself by keeping a job.\u201d He bragged about being forty years old and that he was still enrolled in school eating at the student cafeteria. He wore this image of failure around like a badge of honor. Reminds me of something Hemingway said once, not about Cioran he was speaking more generally here but in a world... where so many people want to wear the medals around in public...but they don\u2019t want to do the work to EARN the medals in private...here is Cioran...a shining example of the opposite...here is a guy... whose work is getting widespread critical acclaim, award after award, and he rejects all of them and instead chooses to live his life RESEMBLING a total failure. The overall point is this: to Cioran...here is this MASSIVE concept...failure...and we\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. We\u2019re supposed to be embarrassed of our failures. And we could theoretically live a life where we never actually try anything and therefore never experience failure...the same way we can rationalize away feelings of dread and melancholy. But to Cioran sometimes we need to \u201cpush\u201d ourselves into existence. We need to reach into areas where we could potentially fail...just to make sure we know we\u2019re still moving in life...and worst case...even if we fail we at least we know who we truly are... at this moment. The trick, I guess, is being able to realize that failure is NOT the worst case scenario. In many ways, constant success would be the worst. Quick aside...some of you are probably wondering how someone so sold on the idea that the world is meaningless and absurd could even speak in terms of success and failure. How does he even decide what to spend his time on if there\u2019s no rulebook to follow? Well Cioran was so dedicated to the cause...he was so committed to the world being meaningless that he actually lived as though there actually WAS meaning to things...he lived this way...just so that he could protest reality and undermine the design of whatever God created this whole thing. Another taboo subject that we\u2019re not supposed to talk about that fascinated Cioran throughout his life is suicide. Look, talking about all these unfortunate aspects of being a person and the solutions we conjure up to try to deal with them...doesn\u2019t take much creativity to arrive at what seems like the ULTIMATE solution to these problems...to just end your life. Well Cioran obviously realized this...and he didn\u2019t think this was the right answer for several reasons, but it should be said that even after arriving at that position... it didn\u2019t stop him from continuing to reflect on suicide as yet another aspect of existence, that is everpresent, that we are not supposed to talk about. He wants to ask...no different than all the other forbidden subjects we\u2019ve touched on... what are we potentially missing out on by putting suicide into this category? And I think the best way to understand where Cioran is coming from here is to think about suicide NOT as something that is actionable. Try for a second to NOT think about suicide as actually something that you\u2019re going to do as a last resort...try to think about suicide in the third person...almost from the outside...try considering the IDEA of suicide as something available to everyone as an aspect of existence...Suicide is an option...an option just like all the other options you have in life. Like for example you have the OPTION to drop and do twenty pushups right now. That is an OPTION AVAILABLE to you. So Cioran might ask...why don\u2019t you do it? Let\u2019s say you decided to do it...one things for sure...the only reason you\u2019re doing twenty pushups right now is because you have a goal you are aspiring to... where twenty pushups actually gets you closer to that goal. Thinking about it in this way...Cioran would ask...what problem is suicide really getting you closer to solving?Cioran thought suicide was both a temporal problem and an error in understanding about life. These are the two main ways you can think of his argument AGAINST suicide. It\u2019s temporal in the sense in that...well, he says it best that \u201cyou always commit suicide too late\u201d. Meaning that you\u2019ve already experienced the inherent pain of existence...you have no idea what the future holds...so ending your life to solve a problem that has already come and gone doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem. The other, more interesting argument he has against suicide is that someone who considers suicide as a solution to a problem is almost always someone that has not thought through the nature of existence at a deep enough level yet. They\u2019re always still at some rest stop along the way of their journey of understanding reality and coming to terms with it honestly. He said:\u201cOnly optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists. The others, having no reason to live, why would they have any to die?\u201dNow, of course here he is referencing the optimism we talked about last episode. When you are confronted, by the sheer meaninglessness and absurdity of existence...common tactic is to join one of these optimism cults that allow you to feel connected to something higher than yourself. To Cioran, it\u2019s only someone immersed in one of these clever rationalizations of meaning that would ever even think to be disappointed when they confront how disinterested the universe truly is. A totally neutral party would be confronted with meaninglessness and wouldn\u2019t have any reason to think one way or the other about it. Once again, as he says...if your reason to commit suicide is that there\u2019s no reason to live...why are you assuming there is some reason to die? Now, someone might respond back to that and say, well there\u2019s tremendous suffering associated with continuing to live...why not end it? But not only does suicide NOT solve the problem of the suffering you\u2019ve already been through...I mean, you\u2019re already at this point...just by SAYING that ending it is a good option... you are not being intellectually consistent. You are claiming that the universe is entirely absurd, and yet you are making value judgments that your suffering is something to avoid...the implication being that the alleviation of that suffering would cut the legs out from your entire argument. Here\u2019s the point: to someone TRULY tapped into the absurdity of things...just as a failure has the same exchange value as a success...a moment of suffering has the same exchange value as a moment of bliss. And just as feelings of dread and melancholy may be a absolutely crucial part of being a human being...suffering may be something that grounds us in ways that we don\u2019t always fully understand. This is why at any one moment you may choose to commit suicide...Cioran thinks you are both making a temporal error and an error of understanding, because once again, you always are committing suicide too late...and you are clearly are still bringing a delusional type of optimism about what existence entails. Now keep in mind this argument IS NOT supposed to be some catch-all antidote to these feelings! This is just the BEGINNING of his look at suicide AS A CONCEPT. And as a concept...this is a philosophical rebuttal...NOT necessarily a PRACTICAL rebuttal at all...this is a philosophical rebuttal to using the OPTION of suicide as an ultimate solution to a problem. This is an important point to emphasize...because if you truly were one of these people that could steer into the meaninglessness of life without fail...besides just your own interest in the subject matter...what reason would you REALLY have to think about suicide at all? So most of what Cioran says ABOUT suicide is most USEFUL TO one of these optimists, somewhere along their journey of coming to terms with the human condition. To these people...of which he was one...I think Cioran would say something along the lines of: just never forget...that you too...are on a journey. It\u2019s both tragic and hilarious...but you are a type of creature, that seems to naturally desire to seek meaning and write stories to make sense of things...and you are on a journey through an absurd realm that is completely devoid of meaning. Once again this would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so problematic to so many people. So maybe AS one of these people you decide to attach yourself to one of these stories and rationalizations...you feel better for a while and generally get through life pretty good...but every once in a while you hit rough patch...where the reality of the universe isn\u2019t something that is as easily brushed under the rug with a bedtime story. Maybe you start to entertain the idea that suicide is an option because what\u2019s the point? And maybe his argument of: well what\u2019s the point of suicide in a meaningless world isn\u2019t compelling to you. I think what he might begin with is to say: okay then...well then what\u2019s the rush? Truly though, suicide may be an option, sure. But explain why it is such a pressing option right this second. Why does it need to be done...right now?\nOnce again, think of suicide in the third person...think of it as an idea or an option that\u2019s available to practically every human being that has the opportunity to exist. When starting from this impersonal place...Cioran began to think of suicide as a concept that he thought was more connected to freedom...than to some sort of last ditch effort to end suffering in a moment of pain. Cioran once said, \u201cWhat really saved me was the idea of suicide. Without the idea of suicide I would\u2019ve surely killed myself.\u201d See, there\u2019s that separation! That distinction between the IDEA of suicide and the actual act. Suicide to Cioran was something that brought him comfort...just knowing...that no matter what he isn\u2019t TRAPPED here. He said that suicide, \u201cends subsistence as a nightmare.\u201d He explicitly says that he could\u2019ve never endured life if it weren\u2019t for this freedom available to him...this option that comforted him because it is always there...so it allowed him to continue to exist however he wanted to...so the question becomes NOT whether or not it\u2019s the right decision to commit suicide from some moral standpoint...the question a person HAS to answer...is simply...why right now? As Cioran said: what\u2019s the rush? Because if there is some sort of rush associated with that decision maybe it\u2019s not being made for the best reasons.I mean, as we\u2019ve covered you\u2019re certainly not trapped here...and you can\u2019t undo what you\u2019ve already been through...you\u2019re already here...in this moment...so why not stick around and and at least spectate the absurdity of it all...try to find pieces of it interesting...try to enjoy the absurdity not because it connects to some greater overarching rhizome of meaning that you\u2019re a piece of...but simply for the sake of the absurdity. Suicide may be an option. But it\u2019s an option tomorrow morning after you\u2019ve slept on it. It\u2019s an option a week from now...it\u2019s an option six months from now after that thing you\u2019re looking forward to. For almost everyone: life is NOT constant suffering and subsistence is not a nightmare. So once you\u2019re confronted with reality why not stick around, enjoy your time, enjoy your family, enjoy those sporting events you like so much, enjoy staring at your phone, enjoy it all immersed in this lucid dream where apparently...nothing really matters. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\nPhilosophize This!\n"
