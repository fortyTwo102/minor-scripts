What I mean by that is that \u2026Science at it\u2019s core is an empirical\u2026realm\u2026ultimately any experiment you\u2019re gonna do as a scientist\u2026 is going to be a PERSON \u2026looking through something like a microscope with their eyes\u2026or a person listening to wavelengths with their ears\u2026this person\u2019s going to be organizing all of this information through very feeble and really a completely arbitrary set of mental faculties that they have\u2026the hope being\u2026that having done this science experiment with our senses\u2026we\u2019ll be a little bit closer to knowing the way that things are in the universe\u2026.the truth!\u00a0\u00a0We think about the truth that way\u2026the truth is this objective thing out there exterior to humans\u2026that we\u2019re trying to come into contact with\u2026the way that things actually are\u2026for example, if every human and every animal was eradicated from the planet tomorrow\u2026and no sentient being was even attempting to try to find out what the truth was\u2026it makes sense that in that universe there\u2019d still be a way that things are\u2026we\u2019re just not around at that point to try to access it. \u00a0\u00a0But that\u2019s the thing\u2026even if we WERE around to try to access it\u2026the chips are stacked against us\u2026We realize our senses are not the greatest tools you could ever have if you\u2019re trying to arrive at this TRUTH that\u2019s out there\u2026that\u2019s the reason we USE things like microscopes and telescopes\u2026to augment our senses and try to access this TRUTH out there. This sort of\u2026cosmic Wikipedia that is fully filled out\u2026now currently the best way we have to access this is through Science\u2026but it didn't always used to be that way\u2026\u00a0Let\u2019s all grab our togas and head back to antiquity for a second. Remember Plato\u2019s dialogues? Remember hearing about Socrates accosting people in the Athenian agora begging people to help him arrive at a better idea of what justice is\u2026or what beauty is\u2026and someone who was really confident that they understood what justice was would give Socrates an answer like, \u201coh, justice is the balancing of the scales. when someone or something wrongs you and takes something away, justice concerns itself with taking something away from that other party so that the scales of justice are balanced out again.\u201d\u2026at which point socrates would execute socraticmethod.exe and would proceed to show them every exception to their rule in existence\u2026the goal being to illustrate to them that they actually DON\u2019T understand what justice is in its entirety, and that more thinking and more discussion about the subject needed to be had.\u00a0Now, Socrates didn\u2019t just do this with everyday people\u2026he did it with his contemporary philosophers as well and if you remember, his reason for doing this\u2026for trying to arrive at the end all be all ultimate definition of the concept of\u2026for example\u2026beauty or good\u2026is that how can we ever begin philosophizing honestly about beauty\u2026if we don\u2019t even fully understand what it is were talking about? The hope was\u2026if we just have enough of these intelligent conversations with each other talking about beauty\u2026asking people for their definitions\u2026finding the exceptions\u2026refining the definitions\u2026finding exceptions to those\u2026that eventually we will have done it: we will have arrived at the true\u2026objective definition of beauty!\u00a0\u00a0Now if this is what you\u2019re doing\u2026the primary assumption that you\u2019re operating under is that these objective definitions of things exist at all\u2026 and what we\u2019re left with after all these years we\u2019ve been having these conversations is not a Webster\u2019s dictionary with the perfect definition of beauty in it\u2026what we\u2019re left with are common figures of speech like, \u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d We say things like\u2026each culture has their own set of ethics\u2026their own idea of what \u201cgood\u201d is to them.\u00a0\u00a0In other words\u2026these concepts of Beauty and Good and many others\u2026we don\u2019t think of them as nouns anymore\u2026we think of them as adjectives. We don\u2019t think of them as an objective thing we\u2019re trying to access like Socrates did back in antiquity\u2026we think of them as subjective value judgements that really just describe a particular type of experience that a human being is having in a particular moment. For example, when I say that a song is beautiful, What i\u2019m talking about is a particular way that song makes me feel\u2026a particular human experience that I\u2019m having that that song is producing in me\u2026I\u2019m not talking about it being representative of some cosmically defined beauty that I\u2019ve gained access to through pondering the concept of beauty.\u00a0\u00a0What I\u2019m saying is: Led Zeppelin is not inherently more beautiful than Justin Bieber\u2026just as a class system is not inherently more \u201cgood\u201d than egalitarianism. How good we think egalitarianism is or how beautiful we think Justin Bieber\u2019s music is largely comes down to a very subjective judgement that we\u2019re making based on all of the prior experiences we\u2019ve had and what sort of feeling is evoked within our bodies\u2026our human experience of something.\u00a0Well if you agree with the statement that beauty is in the eye of the beholder or that there is no cosmically defined \u201cgood\u201d that we can arrive at\u2026the guy we\u2019re gonna be talking about today would probably ask you the question: what if truth\u2026was the exact same way. What if truth isn\u2019t some thing out there that we should be trying to access\u2026what if truth is not a noun\u2026but an adjective we use to describe a particular type of human experience?\u00a0\u00a0Now on the surface this may seem pretty counterintuitive\u2026so let\u2019s give some context so we understand where this guy\u2019s coming from. This guy\u2026is william james\u2026psychologist\u2026philosopher\u20261842-1910\u2026and what william james thought is that if you look back throughout history at the different types of people and why they believe that certain things are true\u2026they can mostly be broken down into being one of two types of people. Two types of people in the world: what he calls tender minded and tough minded.\u00a0\u00a0Quick breakdown\u2026these two types of people often find themselves falling into very predictable categories\u2026a tough minded person is typically somebody that is skeptical\u2026placing a high priority on something being proven for it to be true\u2026a tough minded person tends to be more deterministic\u2026not believing in things like free will\u2026a tough minded person is more likely to be an Atheist\u2026they prefer to learn things through experience rather than reasoning to conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0Now a tender minded person would be the opposite of all those\u2026a tender minded person prefers to learn about things A priori\u2026by thinking about things rather than conducting experiments\u2026a tender minded person tends to be more dogmatic\u2026more willing to accept things to be true without a strong PROOF they can point to\u2026they tend to be more religious, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Now historically, William James would say\u2026this has caused a great deal of tension. When you have one of these tough minded people butting heads with one of these tender minded people and they\u2019re trying to arrive at a conclusion about what the truth is\u2026not much productive conversation usually gets done\u2026they usually can\u2019t even begin having a conversation at all because they disagree so fundamentally with what makes something true\u2026how can they?\u00a0Well, William James thought the philosophical line of thinking known as pragmatism solved this problem and united the tender and tough minded. But before we can understand why James felt that way\u2026we have to understand what\u2019s known as the Pragmatic maxim\u2026an idea laid out initially by a friend of James\u2019 Mr. Charles Sanders Peirce\u2026and it begins like this:\u00a0\u00a0Peirce asks the question: what is wrong with the following statement? A diamond is actually soft, and only becomes hard when it is touched. As opposed to the diamond just always being hard regardless as to whether we\u2019re touching it\u2026What is wrong with that statement?\u00a0\u00a0I mean really, how do you know that the diamond isn\u2019t soft when a human being\u2019s not touching it? How can you honestly prove that it\u2019s not? Now on the surface this may seem somewhat pedantic\u2026but it\u2019s actually a good point he\u2019s making here.\u00a0\u00a0The answer to that question what\u2019s wrong with that statement\u2026is that\u2026there\u2019s NOTHING wrong with that statement\u2026nothing is FALSE about it\u2026 that\u2019s the whole point. Think about it\u2026whether you believe that the diamond was soft until you touched it\u2026or whether you believe that the diamond is hard in perpetuity\u2026absolutely nothing changes about your experience of that diamond, how others will experience that diamond, whether you\u2019re able to put that diamond into a ring as a token of submission to your significant other/overseer. Nothing changes about how we experience that diamond at all\u2026so our belief about this diamond and whether it was soft when we weren\u2019t touching it really ends up not mattering. And think about what that means\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter if you believe that an invisible leprechaun is keeping that diamond hard\u2026nothing changes about the way a human being orients themselves to it.\u00a0\u00a0This is the pragmatic maxim\u2026that the meaning of a concept\u2026is the sensory effect of its object.\u00a0William James has a really famous example that I think illustrates the concept a little bit better\u2026he says pretend you are walking through the woods and you come across a beautiful little squirrel clinging to the side of a tree\u2026and it looks at you\u2026and you make eye contact\u2026and the squirrel decides to scurry around the tree clinging from the bark on the other side of the tree as though it\u2019s trying to hide from you and you say no, no squirrel\u2026i\u2019m not done with you\u2026that\u2019s a beautiful squirrel\u2026i gotta see it again\u2026so you sort of crane your neck trying to catch a glimpse of it\u2019s fluffy tail\u2026you can\u2019t see it\u2026so you begin walking in a circle around the tree trying to see it\u2026but this squirrel has a vendetta\u2026this squirrel isn\u2019t your show pony\u2026it\u2019s not gonna trot around for your viewing pleasure\u2026it decides\u2026its gonna use its psychic powers to just always know where you are and its gonna just always stay on the opposite side of the tree that you\u2019re on. But you\u2019re not going down without a fight\u2026you start running\u2026as fast as you CAN around this tree\u2026but the squirrel prevails\u2026his plan is working\u2026no matter how many times you go around\u2026you can\u2019t see the squirrel.\u00a0\u00a0Now here\u2019s the question: having circled the tree now four or five times\u2026would you say that you had gone AROUND the squirrel? Seems like there\u2019s two ways you can think about it: you could say\u2026yes\u2026I\u2019ve gone around the tree\u2026the squirrel is in between me and the tree\u2026of course i\u2019ve gone around the squirrel i just didn't see it\u2026or you could say\u2026no\u2026i didn\u2019t go around the squirrel it\u2019s face was always facing me the whole time. What would you say?\u00a0Well just like the diamond example\u2026whether you think you DID go around the squirrel or DIDN\u2019T go around the squirrel\u2026neither of these accounts about what happened are actually \u201cfalse statements\u201d\u2026 it really just comes down to how you define \u201cgoing around\u201d the squirrel\u2026if going around means passing to the north south east and west of the squirrel then yes we\u2019ve gone around the squirrel\u2026but if it means passing in front of, to the left right and then behind the squirrel\u2026then no we haven\u2019t gone around the squirrel.\u00a0\u00a0Point is: whether you believe you went around the squirrel or not\u2026nothing changes about what actually happened in reality\u2026you\u2019re still having the same human experience of that event. William James thought this goes beyond just vindictive squirrels in the middle of the woods\u2026us not understanding the practical definitions the other person is using for certain arguments leads us to disagree with people that actually agree with us about what is going on in reality. He said that so many of the disagreements that we have in philosophy or any of the natural sciences\u2026are not really disagreements about reality, but debates about the specific words that are being used.\u00a0\u00a0Now this leads us to the question: what IS reality? what IS truth? And if you were having this conversation with William James\u2026he\u2019d probably start by saying ok, let\u2019s talk about this popular concept of objective truth\u2026let\u2019s establish a baseline here: no one listening to this actually believes in things because they think they are objectively true facts about the universe.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you fancy yourself one of those skeptical, atheistic, tough minded people guided by the evidence and the evidence alone\u2026even if you were the most tough minded person ever and you only believe in the most unbiased, repeatable, triple checked scientific synopsis of the way that things are\u2026you still know that one day many of the things that you believe are gonna be replaced by better science\u2026just look at history\u2026the one constant of science is that it keeps improving upon itself\u2026so in the sense that you don\u2019t believe in things because you think they\u2019re objective truths about the universe, but really just the closest facsimile of that truth available to you during the years you are alive\u2026really you believe in the stuff you do because you see it as the most useful set of beliefs a person can have\u2026it really has nothing to do with whether they\u2019re\u00a0 actually true or not. And as better science comes out and disproves one of your beliefs and gives you a more useful belief\u2026one a little bit closer to that truth hopefully\u2026you\u2019ll adjust your beliefs accordingly and believe in THAT useful belief.\u00a0\u00a0This is what leads william James to make the claim that how truthful an idea is\u2026comes down to how useful it is\u2026or whether it serves the function its meant to serve. He says\u2026much like our belief about whether we actually went around the evil squirrel or not\u2026if we have a belief that doesn\u2019t contradict what we already know\u2026and it serves the purpose of explaining the way that things are and predicts things well that are going to happen in the future\u2026there\u2019s no reason NOT to consider it to be true. Again, think of truth NOT as a noun like Socrates did, but as an adjective describing a certain human experience that we have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTrue ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. False ideas are those we cannot. That is the practical difference it makes to us to have true ideas; that therefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known as.The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process, the process namely of verifying itself, its verification. Its validity is the process of its validation. \u201c\u00a0So an idea is a \u201ctrue\u201d idea if it serves the purpose of giving us a particular useful human experience\u2026just as a piece of artwork is \u201cbeautiful\u201d if it serves the purpose of giving us a particular type of human experience. Now a common question people ask here is: okay, I\u2019m on board with you when it comes to the inevitable progression of science\u2026but what about things that are just true by virtue of definition. Like that a triangle has three sides or that all bachelors are unmarried\u2026can\u2019t you say that these statements are just\u2026true statements\u2026objectively? You don\u2019t really need someone to have a useful human experience to be able to define these as true\u2026William James would say\u2026Those aren\u2019t \u201ctrue\u201d statements\u2026they simply just are the case.\u00a0\u00a0This is a really interesting part of James\u2019s philosophy\u2026remember what were talking about whenever were talking about truth. What William James would say is that whenever we\u2019re talking about something being true\u2026all that we can EVER be talking about is our human experience of some thing. Now, you may say well all he\u2019s doing there is switching the definition of truth! But it starts to make a lot more sense when you look at this connection he thinks there is between belief and what he considers a true idea to be.\u00a0\u00a0So for an idea to be true it needs to be useful\u2026and for an idea to be useful\u2026you actually have to believe in it. I mean, if you don\u2019t believe that the big bang was the event that marked the inception of the universe\u2026how can it ever be an adequate or useful explanation to you? His point there is: you BELIEVING that something is true\u2026is a huge factor in determining whether it\u2019s actually going to be useful to you or not. He gives an example of someone lost in the woods\u2026they have no idea where they are\u2026the only thing they really have to go on is this path that they\u2019re following. Now at this point that person can believe in a couple things, they can believe that the path is going to lead them back to safety and civilization\u2026or they can believe the path is leading them deeper and deeper into the woods making their situation worse.\u00a0\u00a0Now William James would ask: think of how your beliefs determine the outcome of that situation. On one hand, if you believe that the trail is leading you deeper into the woods getting you more lost\u2026why follow it? Why not do nothing or walk in another random direction\u2026the USEFUL way to use that belief is to not follow the trail. Maybe you stay lost out there for days and eventually starve to death. Now on the other hand\u2026if you believe that the trail is going to lead you back to safety\u2026think about it: just as we hold beliefs about science that are incredibly useful to us and we consider them to be true\u2026even though in reality we\u2019re \u201cfiguratively speaking\u201d effectively\u2026lost in the woods our whole life\u2026by believing that those scientifically founded beliefs are accurate\u2026by believing that the path leads to safety\u2026it becomes useful and therefore becomes true to William James.\u00a0This is his basis for the quote: \u201cAct as if what you do makes a difference. It does.\u201d\u00a0Now let\u2019s clear some things up because I already know what many of you are saying: so no matter WHAT I believe\u2026no matter what idea I can come up with\u2026as long as I act on it and it becomes useful to me\u2026it\u2019s therefore is true?\u00a0\u00a0Well, no\u2026 there are certain criteria that William James thinks need to be met by any belief for it to be considered justifiable\u2026let\u2019s talk about them\u2026one\u2026is that there needs to be evidence in its favor. there needs to be some discernible thing that you can point to as evidence of why this is a reasonable idea\u2026but James would say more realistically this usually manifests itself as\u2026the majority of the evidence available to you during your time needs to indicate that it is true\u2026\u00a0Two\u2026the idea needs to be strong enough to be able to stand up to counterarguments. What he means is\u2026If someone can just walk up to you, criticize the idea and leave you speechless in terms of an explanation\u2026it\u2019s probably not passing the test.\u00a0\u00a0Three\u2026once you believe in the idea\u2026the idea isn\u2019t just\u2026 off the hook at that point. It needs to keep proving its worth as something that is useful to you\u2026and part of doing that is consistently predicting future results\u2026if its not doing that\u2026James Would say probably time to believe in something else that\u2019s a little more useful.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the great thing about these three criteria, is that they account for both types of people\u2026the tender minded AND the tough minded. They account for all different time periods\u2026for people living in today\u2019s world or people living in medieval superstition. For example if you were living in Western Europe in the 1400s and you believed it to be true that the earth is flat\u2026William James would say that even though we know now that it\u2019s a sphere\u2026your belief that the earth was flat was a true belief back then because remember, truth is an adjective describing a specific type of human experience\u2026 the experience someone had with that belief back in the 1400\u2019s is the same as the experience we have today with the idea that the earth is a sphere.\u00a0Just to make this more clear\u2026let\u2019s look at this example through the lens all three criteria so we can see how similar our experiences really are.\u00a0\u00a0First criteria we need\u2026evidence it is true.\u00a0\u00a0Well, just as we would point to something like satellite imagery that shows that the earth is a sphere\u2026someone in the 1400\u2019s would point to the\u2026you know\u2026 eye witness testimony from the guy with a peg leg that saw an entire ship of noble fishermen get sucked down to davy jones\u2019s locker. He swears it happened\u2026he even saw it with his good eye! Nobody\u2026second guesses his good eye.\u00a0\u00a0Second criteria\u2026the idea needs to able to withstand criticism.\u00a0So\u2026In today\u2019s world, if someone came up to you and offered a counter argument and said something like\u2026well if the earth is so round\u2026why does the horizon look flat no matter how high up you go? We could no doubt argue back and talk about how things appear to the human eye and fixtures in the landscape only made possible by the curvature of the earth\u2026our idea that the earth is a sphere is going to be able to withstand criticism\u2026just as the average person in the 1400\u2019s probably isn\u2019t going to be running into many people like Sir Isaac Newton that is able to provide a compelling argument that refutes their belief that the earth is flat.\u00a0Third criteria\u2026 the idea needs to continue to help you predict future outcomes.\u00a0So\u2026In today\u2019s world\u2026our idea that the earth is spherical would continue to be reinforced\u2026right?\u2026 we\u2019d continue to compensate for the spherical shape of the earth\u2026we\u2019d continue to adjust flight patterns in the interest of saving time by taking advantage of the shape of the earth\u2026and we would continue to reap rewards from doing that. Just as\u2026Back in the 1400\u2019s they would continue to hear stories about people falling off the edge of the earth, they\u2019d continue to predict that those crazy people that are going on that super long voyage near the edge of the earth\u2026yeah they\u2019re probably not coming back. And when they didn\u2019t it would serve as confirmation that what they believe is true.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Point is: just like with the squirrel\u2026just like with the diamond\u2026our human experience of our belief that the earth is a sphere\u2026how useful it is to us, how well it predicts future outcomes that are relevant to us\u2026we have the same experience with our belief that the earth is a sphere\u2026that someone back in the 1400\u2019s would have with their belief that the earth is flat! And to William James, both of these beliefs would be worthy of the adjective true when describing them, given their respective contexts and how they allow people to orient themselves to the world.\u00a0You know\u2026many people take issue with James because they think he\u2019s being far too tolerant of these beliefs like\u2026the earth is flat. We shouldn\u2019t allow that to be called true\u2026but keep in mind\u2026this is entirely contingent upon them living in a different time when other evidence was unavailable. He would no doubt take issue with that belief in today\u2019s world given how it doesn\u2019t stand up to his three criteria\u2026and in that sense he is FAR from tolerant of people just believing in whatever they want. By the way\u2026that extends on to you as well\u2026once a more useful, for most of us more accurate, interpretation of some subject comes out\u2026if your beliefs no longer hold up to scrutiny\u2026he would be equally as abrasive to your beliefs as well.\u00a0Maybe the best thing to reiterate at this point is that William James sees truth not as something inside of objects themselves, but our experience of how we orient ourselves to things in the world. You know, he wrote a book called the varieties of religious experience where he dissects\u2026basically every type of religious idea that people can have and tries to find similarities between them\u2026and the interesting thing is\u2026William James doesn\u2019t think of religion the same way many of us do\u2026he doesn\u2019t think religion is limited to only things like Christianity\u2026Hinduism\u2026Orphism\u2026no William James thinks that ANY fundamentalist interpretation of life should be considered a religion\u2026because it\u2019s ultimately the same type of thinking going on.\u00a0\u00a0That could include any number of things\u2026unbridled nationalism\u2026racism\u2026sexism\u2026religion to William James is better described as, \u201cman\u2019s total reaction upon life.\u201d\u00a0There\u2019s a great quote in the introduction of the book:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe must therefore, from the experiential point of view, call these godless or quasi-godless creeds \u2018religions\u2019; and accordingly when in our definition of religion we speak of the individual\u2019s relation to \u2018what he considers the divine,\u2019 we must interpret the term \u2018divine\u2019 very broadly, as denoting any object that is godlike, whether it be a concrete deity or not.\u201d\u00a0Beautifully worded\u2026obviously what he\u2019s saying here is look: just because someone\u2019s simplified way they look at things doesn\u2019t have a ten headed deity with horns involved, don\u2019t think that the \u201cdivine\u201d qualities many traditional religions place on that thing are incapable of being conferred onto something like\u2026you know the founding fathers\u2026or David Duke.\u00a0\u00a0By the way real quick\u2026i realize there\u2019s people alive today that strongly believe that the earth is flat\u2026and they have tons of evidence to support why that has to be the case. I\u2019d just like to ask for you to be understanding of me having to find an example for this episode\u2026you must realize you\u2019re part of a small handful of intellectual elites that have watched the same YouTube videos you have\u2026and you certainly must realize that the vast, vast majority of us listening to this episode are uneducated sheep that are victims of propaganda. The point was not to continue my covert shilling for the CIA\u2026it was to try my best to explain some William James. By the way, if you\u2019re out there\u2026please reach out to me! I really want to know why all the governments of the world benefit from concealing that the earth is flat.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0"
