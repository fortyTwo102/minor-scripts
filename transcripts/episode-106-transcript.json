    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #106\u00a0on Simone De Beauvoir. Check out the episode page HERE.So last episode we talked about Sartre\u2019s idea that at the foundation of who we are\u2026 there\u2019s a constant tug of war that\u2019s going on between what he calls our Facticity and our Transcendence. Our Facticity being the facts that are true about us at any given moment and our Transcendence being the possibilities that we have at our disposal. Last episode, what followed from this, for Sartre\u2026is that people are made massively uncomfortable by this constant tug of war that\u2019s going on\u2026 and we all tend to gravitate towards removing one side of the people pulling on the rope\u2026 we either want to ignore the facts that are true about us or ignore the possibilities that we have so that one side will just fall into the mud pit already and we can all stop pulling on this stupid rope.But unfortunately\u2026 Sartre would say\u2026 the game never actually ends. Despite the fact you may view yourself as some sort of completed project\u2026the reality is that through your actions\u2026 you are constantly creating and re-creating yourself in each passing moment\u2026.every second, that passes you change in some small way\u2026the reality is: we all exist in this place of tension\u2026this tug of war that\u2019s going on between two sides of a duality called our Facticity and Transcendence.But Simone De Beauvoir is going to take that one step further. The implications of which form the basis of her book The Ethics of Ambiguity. Just listen for second to the very first paragraph of the book and then we\u2019ll talk about what she\u2019s getting at:\u201cTHE continuous work of our life,\u201d says Montaigne, \u201cis to build death.\u201d Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. \u201cRational animal,\u201d \u201cthinking reed,\u201d he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.\u201dNow you can just hear in that passage\u2026 she\u2019s describing what she\u2019s later going to go on to call the Ambiguity of human existence. Let\u2019s talk about what she means by that. She\u2019d say sure, Sartre at any given moment we are both Facticity and Transcendence\u2026it\u2019s a duality we exist within\u2026like we talked about last episode, when you take an honest look at what it is to be me\u2026I am what I am...but simultaneously I also am what I am not yet. And if somebody asked you\u2026so\u2026 which one are you really are you the facts about who you are right now, or are you the possibilities you\u2019re currently bringing about? That\u2019d be kind of a confusing question because the answer is: I\u2019m BOTH. Yes, people commonly fall into bad faith and try to remove one side of it\u2026but the reality is I am BOTH Facticity and Transcendence simultaneously and that reality creates a certain tension for me.But Simone De Beauvoir would point out\u2026that when you take a closer look at human existence\u2026it starts to look like we\u2019re not just engaged in a single game of tug of war that\u2019s going on\u2026it\u2019s not just Facticity and Transcendence\u2026we seem to be engaged\u2026 in MANY different games of tug of war all at the same time.See because yes, I am both Facticity and Transcendence. But what else am I? Lots of things she would say. For example\u2026 at any given moment, I am simultaneously both a subject navigating the world and an object within other people\u2019s subjective view of the world. So what am I? Am I a subject or an object? What if I\u2019m both of them simultaneously and that existing within that duality creates a certain level of tension for me? Another example\u2026at any given moment, I am both an individual person and a member of a collective group, family, nation-state, species, whatever. So what am I? Am I an individual or a part of a larger group? What if I\u2019m both simultaneously and that existing within that duality creates a certain level of tension for me? Mind and matter. Self and other. The examples of these dualities that we exist between go on over the horizon\u2026and Simone De Beauvoir would say that when you look back at the history of philosophy and religion\u2026so many of the ideas that have been laid out over the years have been people trying to reduce one side of these dualities\u2026 so that we can simplify the world down into terms that are less ambiguous. To escape the true reality of the Ambiguity of being a human in this world. Whether it was to think of the world as merely an earthly shadow of flawed forms\u2026whether it was to think of ourselves as a mind perched up within a brain, or a soul inhabiting a body\u2026or as a member of a state with a duty to fulfill that transcends your individual desires\u2026within each and every one of these and many more\u2026 you can see what Simone De Beauvoir says is an attempt to over-simplify our human condition, and escape the true Ambiguity of existence. The ethics of Ambiguity is just filled with iconic quotes that are unforgettable\u2026about this point she says: `\u201cAt the present time there still exist many doctrines which choose to leave in the shadow certain troubling aspects of a too complex situation. But their attempt to lie to us is in vain. Cowardice does not pay. Those reasonable metaphysics, those consoling ethics with which they would like to entice us only accentuate the disorder from which we suffer.\u201dJust listen to that quote\u2026those REASONABLE metaphysics, those CONSOLING ethics with which they would like to entice us\u2026that is just great writing. And shots fired at Philosophers and Theologians throughout history\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying they start to look guilty of what your average person does when they fall into Bad Faith\u2026how is what they\u2019re doing any different than reducing one side of your Facticity and Transcendence to try to escape a state of tension.No\u2026to be an honest human being\u2026is to be in a state of tension\u2026it\u2019s to BE in a state of ambiguity. Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying\u2026we feel the effects of this ambiguity\u2026and our kneejerk response throughout history has been to feel like something\u2019s missing\u2026she says we recognize a \u201clack\u201d in ourselves (important word)\u2026we feel like somethings missing and that if only we can come up with the right philosophical rationalization to make us feel like we understand the world perfectly\u2026then the ambiguity\u2019s gonna go away\u2026then we\u2019re going to be COMPLETE as people.What Simone De Beauvoir is asking here is what if we\u2019re never meant to be completed as people? And that no matter what story you decide tell yourself to run from the ambiguity\u2026what if it\u2019s just not as simple as I am purely a spirit\u2026or I\u2019m PURE energy\u2026or PURELY an American\u2026what if the world, what if being a human being is not black and white like that\u2026what if it\u2019s black, white and grey simultaneously and that we purposefully look at it through a very small lens to make us feel like its more simple than it really is? What would happen\u2026 if somebody stopped running from this Ambiguity and just embraced it, what would that person look like? Could you ever be happy living within that ambiguity? Is there any reasonable foundation that you can approach how to best behave within that ambiguity? This is the task of the ethics of ambiguity.Now if you\u2019re gonna be an existentialist writing an approach to ethics like Simone De Beauvoir is\u2026there\u2019re going to be certain classic questions that arise that you\u2019ll have to address at some point. One of them is that\u2026. if existence precedes essence\u2026if it is the job of the individual to create their own values and meaning to life\u2026how can anyone ever say that the values I arrive at are any less or more valid than anyone else\u2019s. What I mean is, if someone arrived at a set of values that said raping and murdering people was a good thing\u2026if I\u2019m not appealing to some standard of good and evil behavior, if existence precedes essence\u2026how can I ever say that worldview is wrong?Well to begin answering this question\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s going to cite a famous line that Sartre writes in Being and Nothingness\u2026it\u2019s the idea that \u201cMan is condemned to be free.\u201d Where she\u2019s going with this is that\u2026even if there\u2019s no objective good and evil written into the universe\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not certain, fundamental aspects about the human condition that we have to consider when navigating our lives\u2026we are condemned to breath, we are condemned to forage for food, we are condemned to turn read receipts off on our cellphones\u2026but she\u2019d say more important than all of those things, we are condemned to be free\u2026we are condemned without our prior consent, to a life where we have to be constantly making choices\u2026she points out how\u2026even if you try to deny this reality\u2026 even if you just sit around or fall into bad faith and do nothing your whole life\u2026the choice to do nothing\u2026 is still a choice you\u2019re making, The fact that we\u2019re condemned to freedom\u2026the fact that we can make practically any choice we want is the very thing that allows us to create the meaning to our lives\u2026in other words\u2026this essence we\u2019re talking about ultimately relies on this more fundamental aspect of the human condition that we are free\u2026and if you examine this freedom closely, she thinks there are certain essences (like raping and murdering people) that are just flat out contradictory to arrive at.See because, the very idea of morality relies on the idea that people are free enough to choose between at least two different alternatives. Right, I mean if somebody was truly powerless over acting in a particular way, the whole concept of morality evaporates. For example if you were down at the beach and you lost control of your skateboard\u2026and it was rolling towards the edge of the boardwalk about to go into the ocean\u2026and your friend was near the edge and could easily put their foot out and stop the skateboard, but let\u2019s say they don\u2019t\u2026let\u2019s say they look at you\u2026look at the skateboard\u2026hands on their knees smiling as they stare at the skateboard plummeting into the ocean\u2026you might call their behavior into question.Now same situation, but this time you lost control of your 18-wheeler semi-truck\u2026you\u2019re probably not gonna wonder why they didn\u2019t dive in front of it like they\u2019re superman\u2026they were powerless, there was nothing they could do about it in that situation. This is an example of how the whole idea\u2026 of what we\u2019re morally obligated to do\u2026 is directly connected to the amount of freedom we have in a given situation\u2026or as Simone De Beauvoir puts it you don\u2019t offer an ethics to a God\u2026you don\u2019t offer ethics to someone who thinks they can\u2019t make mistakes or on the other hand to anyone who thinks they\u2019re powerless to the point they can\u2019t make choices. Good news for us is: in actuality we\u2019re neither of these things, people just tell themselves they are\u2026and because this whole discussion of ethics and what we\u2019re morally accountable for\u2026 is ultimately contingent upon our level of freedom\u2026it follows to Simone De Beauvoir\u2026that any serious discussion about what we\u2019re morally accountable to do at the VERY least\u2026 needs to begin from a place that maximizes that default state that we\u2019re born into: condemned to be free.In other words: in the same way we shouldn\u2019t deny one side of these dualities we exist between in an attempt to run from the ambiguity of existence\u2026we shouldn\u2019t deny that we are condemned to be free. We should recognize the fundamental aspect of our being THAT we are free, embrace it and then move in the direction of behaviors that MAXIMIZE that freedom rather than run from it. Now the extension of this\u2026and one of the highly unique aspects of her Ethics we\u2019re gonna talk a lot more about next episode\u2026is that to TRULY maximize your freedom to Simone De Beauvoir requires the maximization of the freedom of others\u2026that for many reasons, you can\u2019t really be totally free unless if other people around you are totally free.Again, we\u2019re gonna talk all about it next episode because that\u2019s the third and final part of the Ethics of Ambiguity\u2026 and what we\u2019ve been talking about so far is what she lays out in part one. So what does that leave us with? Part two\u2026I guess I just want to talk for a second about how this book is structured\u2026it\u2019s pretty brilliant what she does and I didn\u2019t really realize what exactly she was doing when I first read it years ago. So, part one lays out this whole idea of the Ambiguity of existence and the maximization of freedom\u2026part three lays out how we should actually be behaving in practice, and part two can read like a sort of a tangential aside where she wants to put certain people on blast for not being free enough\u2026but the genius of what she\u2019s doing in part two is that she foresees the people coming along reading her work mistakenly thinking they have it all figured out\u2026she foresees people saying stuff like, ambiguity? Oh yeah\u2026WAY ahead of you Ms. De Beauvoir, way ahead of you\u2026LONG AGO I accepted the true ambiguity of existence and even LONGER BEFORE THAT when I was but a child I realized how free I am to choose anything I want. Sometimes it gets lonely\u2026you know \u2026being so smart\u2026being so much more free than everyone else around me\u2026but it\u2019s not all bad I find humor in their feeble attempts to deny their freedom\u2026This is what\u2019s so awesome about part two\u2026Simone De Beauvoir lays out like 12 different personality types of people that she sees around her\u2026personalities that you still see EVERYWHERE in today\u2019s world\u2026some very simple, some very nuanced, but ALL OF WHICH are examples of tactics people use to convince themselves they are free when they actually could be much more free\u2026not only that though\u2026when you look at these types of people that she talks about\u2026 Simone De Beauvoir thinks all of these different approaches to looking at life\u2026 are reactions to when we were children\u2026they\u2019re reaction to when we were first faced with the reality, the true freedom and responsibility that\u2019s required of us, in adulthood.She says two things happen when we\u2019re kids: one, we\u2019re born\u2026and we look at adults as these authoritative sources of information\u2026 people that have grasped the ultimate values of life and we need to be more like them. We seem them as these\u2026COMPLETED people\u2026these people that have figured out what\u2019s lacking like we talked about before and have COMPLETED themselves. But again, what if in reality\u2026we NEVER complete ourselves. What are THEY doing then?The second thing that happens is that throughout the entire time you\u2019re a kid, you live in a state\u2026 of never having to deal with the ambiguity of existence\u2026your parents\u2026protect you from that and what you end up doing is running around, playing and just being a kid. In other words, what Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s saying is that for the first 16 years of your life or so\u2026you don\u2019t even KNOW about the ambiguity of existence\u2026you don\u2019t even know about this constant state of tension that life truly is. You know, there\u2019s people that have emailed me and asked why do you think we have such a tendency to gravitate towards bad faith, as opposed to embracing our freedom? Well, how can you blame people? You\u2019re faced the reality of the freedom and responsibility of adulthood\u2026and when you look around you at the role models you have at your disposal\u2026they\u2019re all people that claim to have this whole life thing figured out. They\u2019re all people using one of these strategies she talks about, convincing themselves that they\u2019ve COMPLETED themselves.Kind of like Nietzsche and the whole Camel, Lion and Child progression he lays out in Thus Spoke Zarathustra\u2026Simone De Beauvoir structures all these different types of people in part two in a similar sort of way where there\u2019s a progression\u2026a progression from the least free to the most free. Now, the LEAST free person\u2026the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of freedom\u2026is what Simone De Beauvoir calls the \u201csub-man\u201d. The sub-man is that guy working at Subway making sandwiches all day\u2026what a loser says Simone De Beauvoir\u2026just kidding she\u2019s talking about a different kind of sub\u2026sub meaning below.Simone De Beauvoir describes this person as the kind of person who\u2019s sort of apathetic about everything all the time. She says they feel \u201c like nothing merits desire or effort\u201d. That everything\u2019s dull\u2026nothing is really that impressive ever\u2026they see things other people do\u2026they shrug a lot\u2026meh\u2026okay. Nothing really is worth their time.Simone De Beauvoir says that what this is\u2026 is a child that saw just how much freedom adulthood had in store for them\u2026they saw the sheer number of possible projects they could work on throughout their life\u2026they felt really uncomfortable\u2026 and then in an attempt to ease their discomfort and return to that\u2026safe, unambiguous cocoon of childhood\u2026they sort of retreated and closed themselves off from the world.People with a lot of different interests and a lot of capability are at a higher risk for becoming a sub-man\u2026reason being because they look at all the possibilities and say man I could do anything\u2026I could be a Veterinarian, I could be a news anchor, I could be a scientist\u2026you know what\u2026who cares about any of it? They deny that there\u2019s any sort of tension or lack within themselves that requires action\u2026 and they COMPLETE themselves\u2026 by choosing, nothing\u2026De Beauvoir says\u2026and the problem with someone choosing nothing on a social level\u2026 is that they become potential members of a mob. They become malleable fodder for the projects that other people are working on\u2026 as long as those people can persuade the sub-men to be temporarily emboldened by whatever cause they give them to support. Sub-man\u2019s often referred to as what people call a \u201csheep\u201d.The second rung on this ladder of types of people\u2026little more free than the Sub-man, but still deeply enslaved and running from the ambiguity of existence\u2026 is what she calls the Serious-man. The serious-man makes up probably around\u2026 70% of people\u2026this is by far the most common tactic people use to remove themselves from ambiguity. The Serious man is any version of somebody that denies their transcendence and turns themselves into pure facticity for the sake of a cause. This is the child facing the freedom of adulthood\u2026 all grown up now saying something like: I am a life long democrat and I\u2019m always going to be a democrat. I\u2019ve harnessed the ultimate values of life and completed myself like my parents did. I am an evangelical Christian and I will be that way until the day I die. I have discovered a set of absolute values.Make no mistake\u2026Simone De Beauvoir\u2019s not saying that being any of these things is wrong\u2026it\u2019s your relationship to how you view the title. Do you live your life as though being a democrat or being a Christian is some sort of permanent, irreversible aspect about who you are? If so, then Simone De Beauvoir would say you are a Serious man, trying to give yourself an essence and escape the true ambiguity of your life\u2026and if you look back at history even just to the 20th century\u2026you don\u2019t gotta look very long to see the bloodshed that often comes when people think they\u2019ve harnessed an ultimate set of values\u2026 that\u2019s what Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s worried about.Now another important rung on this ladder a little higher up\u2026is a response to the freedom of adulthood\u2026that\u2019s a true classic. We\u2019ve all heard of this one before. I\u2019m talking about Nihilism.Quick recap of the ladder up until this point: The sub man either doesn't realize there\u2019s a lack in their being\u2026 or denies the whole idea of there being something lacking...the serious man acknowledges that there\u2019s a lack\u2026 and then believes a story about something that will complete him as a person. And, the nihilist\u2026 realizes there\u2019s a lack and that nothing can complete them...so they ask themselves question, why bother doing anything at all?Now Nihilism is a particularly dangerous place to be if you\u2019re Simone De Beauvoir\u2026and the reason why is because the Nihilist\u2026is partially right. They\u2019ve arrived at the truth about the ambiguity of existence\u2026but they\u2019re making a big assumption after arriving at that conclusion that blinds them from the fact that they aren\u2019t seeing the WHOLE truth about existence\u2026and it\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s a very easy trap to fall into and then convince yourself that you\u2019re right, citing that piece of truth you\u2019ve accessed as justification.I want to read you a passage out of the ethics of ambiguity where Simone De Beauvoir talks about why the Nihilist is wrong. Full disclosure, I have this passage hanging in the front room of my house\u2026it\u2019s one of my favorite passages from all of existentialism. We\u2019ll read it and then we\u2019ll talk about what she means by it:\u201cThe nihilist attitude manifests a certain truth. In this attitude one experiences the ambiguity of the human condition. But the mistake is that it defines man not as the positive existence of a lack, but as a lack at the heart of existence, whereas the truth is that existence is not a lack as such. And if freedom is experienced in this case in the form of rejection, it is not genuinely fulfilled. The nihilist is right in thinking that the world possesses no justification and that he himself is nothing. But he forgets that it is up to him to justify the world and to make himself exist validly. Instead of integrating death into life, he sees in it the only truth of the life, which appears to him as a disguised death. However, there is life, and the nihilist knows that he is alive. That\u2019s where his failure lies. He rejects existence without managing to eliminate it. He denies any meaning to his transcendence, and yet he transcends himself. A man who delights in freedom can find an ally in the nihilist because they contest the serious world together, but he also sees in him an enemy insofar as the nihilist is a systematic rejection of the world and man, and if this rejection ends up in a positive desire destruction, it then establishes a tyranny which freedom must stand up against.\u201dI guess a good place to start unpacking that is to say that if it weren\u2019t for the Nihilist being partially right\u2026and recognizing the true ambiguity of things\u2026they would be no different than the serious man. Because just like the serious man\u2026 who might say something like, ok I am a Morman\u2026and I possess certain ultimate values that are written into the cosmos, I am complete\u2026a Nihilist is making the same kind of proclamation by saying \u201cthere is no cosmically written meaning to my life\u201d, I am complete. In other words, why are we both speaking on behalf of the universe here? I mean at least the Mormon believes in a God that gave them this information\u2026what is the Nihilists based on? The way it intuitively seems to me as a human being in an ambiguous world?I\u2019m not saying this because there IS some cosmically written meaning necessarily\u2026the point is: where did this expectation of the Nihilist come from? Lot of people think it\u2019s an another one of those things we talked about last time\u2026it\u2019s an extension of generation after generation of people thinking of themselves as something born into a realm\u2026that doesn\u2019t belong to them. This universe is private property...God built this place\u2026he\u2019s bestowed upon you the gift of life\u2026 and as long as you\u2019re staying here\u2026there\u2019s some chores he wants you to do. When the Nihilist realizes this way of thinking is a relic of a bygone era\u2026they mistakenly assume that because there\u2019s no God out there to confer a meaning onto them\u2026that therefore\u2026there must be no meaning to ANYTHING that I do!But what if that whole dream of being handed some pre-packaged meaning to your life was never how it worked at all? What if that was an assumption? What is meaning anyway\u2026it\u2019s just a human construct\u2026a word. What if the same way you have to choose a career\u2026and the same way you have to choose a life partner\u2026and these things take years of thought to fully realize\u2026what if it\u2019s your responsibility to choose a meaning to your life?What I\u2019m saying is: what if there IS a meaning to your life? And I\u2019m not saying that like I\u2019m some late night pastor\u2026what Simone De Beauvoir would ask is what if when you make a grandiose proclamation like \u201cthere is no meaning to my life\u201d\u2026you just did it\u2026right there\u2026you just declared the meaning of your life to be that you\u2019re going to sit around making proclamations about how nothing matters on a cosmic level (genius) and then use it as justification never take action on anything. You can\u2019t HELP but have a meaning to your life to Simone De Beauvoir\u2026it is created and recreated by your actions in each passing moment.The question is: what\u2019s the meaning of your life gonna be? To sit around on the couch doing nothing? Or to transcend. To get out of that job that sucks the life out of you\u2026or to travel the world or to help maximize the freedom of others? To leave the house\u2026feel the fires of hell on your skin as sunlight hits it for the first time in eight months? What is the meaning gonna be?Next time we\u2019ll talk more about more of the rungs of the ladder, more of these= types of ways children respond to the startling level of freedom and responsibility required in adulthood\u2026 as well as the importance of maximizing the freedom of others, why we can never be truly free unless if others are free around us and the wisdom that lies in living a life in the service of others. You know whenever I read part three of the Ethics of Ambiguity and I get all excited about the importance of finding a way to serve others in this miserable existence it always brings me back to ironically ANOTHER quote that I have on my wall by Rabandranath Tagore\u2026and I\u2019ll leave you today with it:I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy.Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time."
