    "spoken_text": "\u00a0This is a transcript of episode #087\u00a0on Albert Camus. Check out the episode page HERE.\u00a0So as you probably know by now\u2026philosophy\u2026more specifically the more abstract, out there ideas in philosophy can be a pretty tough thing to just cannonball into and fully understand them right off the bat\u2026and I think most educators realize this\u2026and a useful tool that i think a lot of them use to sort of\u2026set up a skeleton of an idea that they can flesh out later with more of the details\u2026 is they try to take big ideas or even entire branches of philosophy and distill them down into a single sentence\u2026or a single question.\u00a0For example, epistemology\u2026notoriously referred to as the branch of philosophy that asks: how do we know what we know? Now, that\u2019s great as a working definition of epistemology if you need a frame of reference as you\u2019re learning about it\u2026but the more you DO learn about it the more you realize that\u2026 that\u2019s really only a fraction of what epistemology actually deals with.\u00a0Metaphysics\u2026notoriously referred to as the branch of philosophy that asks: what is everything made out of and how did it get here. Again, great definition for educational purposes, but the more you look into it the more you realize all of the metaphysics that definition is leaving out.\u00a0\u00a0Now the guy we\u2019re going to be talking about today, Albert Camus, he thought that he had found the most fundamental question in all of philosophy\u2026a question that he thought\u2026no matter what other philosophical question you could ever come up with\u2026it was ultimately going to be a follow up question to THIS question\u2026but the problem is if I just SAY the question\u2026uh i\u2019ve I\u2019ve found that a lot of people initially disagree with him and end up poised waiting to disagree with everything else the guys saying.\u00a0So what I wanted to do to give some context to this question\u2026just so we can better understand where Camus is coming from when he\u2019s asking it\u2026is I wanted to tell you a story from Greek Mythology about a King named Sisyphus. Sisyphus was the kinda king\u2026he wasn\u2019t really feeling the whole Pantheon of Gods thing\u2026you know the whole I\u2019m gonna rape you and then blast you all over the cosmos and make you into the big dipper\u2026no Sisyphus was known as someone all throughout his life that didn\u2019t really march to the beat of the drum of the God\u2019s so it came as no surprise when one day\u2026when it was his time to die\u2026Hades\u2026LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD came to get Sisyphus, wrap him up in chains, and suck him down into the blackened recesses of his realm.\u00a0\u00a0Now Sisyphus\u2026cunning as he was\u2026when death shows up to take him\u2026he starts talking to the lord of the underworld\u2026and somehow convinces him of testing the chains out on himself before he uses them on him\u2026so when death\u2019s all tied up and says yep these chains definitely seem to be in working order!\u2026Sisyphus just throws him in his closet and goes on about his business. Now as you can imagine\u2026there are some consequences when death doesn\u2019t show up to work\u2026for one thing\u2026people can\u2019t die. Throughout the myth of Sisyphus they give all kinds of examples of how people would get killed on the battlefield and still show up to dinner that night\u2026people would get like run over by a horse and just stand up and dust themselves off. Point is: the Gods soon realized what had happened. Now as you can ALSO imagine\u2026for Sisyphus\u2026kidnapping the lord of the underworld and hiding him in your closet has some serious consequences as well. So the God\u2019s sentenced him to one of the most horrible fates imaginable\u2026it\u2019s a motif we\u2019ve all probably seen at some point in our lives\u2026Sisyphus is the guy condemned by the gods to a lifetime\u2026 of rolling a boulder up a hill\u2026back breaking, grueling labor\u2026only to reach the top of the hill and have the boulder inevitably roll back down to the bottom for him to start over again. Condemned to a lifetime of pain and anguish and working hard only to have his efforts be completely futile in the end\u2026the boulder will always roll back down to the bottom of the hill.\u00a0Now Camus would say\u2026what a wonderful metaphor for your life. Now I\u2019ll explain his reasoning in a second but just imagine\u2026if this is true\u2026imagine If the life you live right now is comparable to rolling a boulder up a hill only to have it inevitably fall back down again\u2026if that is true\u2026then as Albert Camus says, \u201cThere is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is the decision of whether or not to commit suicide.\u201d This is his fundamental philosophical question that I was talking about\u2026this is the question that underlies EVERYTHING else. Should we commit suicide?\u00a0Now hold on at this point you might be saying\u2026alright\u2026don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just a little bit melodramatic\u2026Camus? My life isn\u2019t that bad\u2026I\u2019m not condemned by the Gods\u2026I\u2019m not rolling a boulder up a hill everyday\u2026I don\u2019t even like boulders.\u00a0\u00a0Well it\u2019s a metaphor\u2026Camus would say: look. we\u2019re born, we grow up, we get a job and it\u2019s so easy in this modern life for people to fall into this momentum of living the same exact day over and over again\u2026up, work, home, TV, bed, up, work, home, TV, bed, up work\u2026you get it.\u00a0\u00a0This isn\u2019t how human beings were meant to live\u2026it\u2019s monotonous, it\u2019s tremendously unfulfilling, it\u2019s practically devoid of anything that feels even remotely rewarding. Saddest part about it to Camus is that most people just go along with it and don\u2019t ever really question it. This is just the way life is! I\u2019ve resigned myself to a life of sleeping pills and caramel macchiatos.\u00a0\u00a0But not everybody ends up this way. Camus would say if you\u2019re not one of these people that just sort of sheepishly goes along with it and never questions it\u2026well\u2026then you\u2019re one of the lucky few that get to have your very own existential crisis! Congratulations. Because what happens when you really take a look at that lifestyle\u2026that up, work, home, TV, bed\u2026lifestyle\u2026is you start to wonder if any of this stuff you\u2019re doing everyday matters at all. You start to feel isolated\u2026alienated. You start to look at death looming on the horizon, you start to wonder\u2026am I wasting this gift of life\u2026 and you can\u2019t help but feel really uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0So IN an attempt to alleviate this discomfort\u2026You start to ask yourself some really tough questions\u2026questions that are trying to get some clarity about this existence: what is the purpose of my life or the universe for that matter\u2026what is the meaning\u2026is life really just me watching netflix until I go casket shopping one day?\u00a0\u00a0Camus talks about how when we find ourselves in this uncomfortable place we seem to have this longing for happiness\u2026and this appetite for clarity\u2026or an appetite for being able to make sense of everything\u2026trying to find the purpose that we serve\u2026and an extremely common place people start LOOKING for that purpose\u2026just given the last several thousand years of human thought\u2026is that they try to look for some sort of preordained cosmically prescribed meaning to it all. They look at their place within the universe and they start to ask\u2026what plan did this universe have for me? What function do I serve in the grand scheme of things?\u00a0They ask these questions and what do they get? Silence. Nothing answers you back as a human being when you ask those questions. It\u2019s not like some customer service rep from the universe call center picks up. Well Camus would say\u2026given that fact\u2026that leaves you with a very real problem on your hands\u2026\u2026Because if nobodies picking up at the call center for the universe\u2026\u2026we don't KNOW what the purpose of the universe is. We don\u2019t KNOW what our purpose is\u2026or if we even have one\u2026and what\u2019s worse is that\u2026you\u2019re just a human being. The only tools you have\u2026to arrive at the MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE\u2026are your eyes, ears\u2026you know your sensory experience\u2026and your ability to reason. That\u2019s it!\u00a0The fact that you\u2019re met with silence\u2026when you ask those fundamental questions of your existence\u2026probably means your tools aren\u2019t doing the job that well. Now you can draw any number of conclusions from this\u2026a common one is that\u2026maybe we DO in fact have a purpose\u2026but TO whatever prescribed that purpose\u2026it\u2019s just not very important for us to know for certain what that purpose is\u2026or maybe\u2026if we KNEW what our purpose was\u2026it would sabotage our ability to fulfill that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0For example Genesis 1:28. God tells Adam rule over all the fish and fowl and every living creature that moves on the ground. Which I just realized doesn\u2019t really cover underground animals\u2026maybe moles are onto something\u2026uh\u2026point is if you believe that the purpose of every animal in the world is for us to rule over them, part of that being that God allows us to eat these creatures\u2026A cow doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s purpose\u2026and you can imagine how if that cow KNEW it\u2019s purpose\u2026it might inhibit its ability to fulfill that purpose\u2026it would be trying to stay away from us lucky humans as much as possible so it can survive. Maybe\u2026 it\u2019s the same way for human beings\u2026maybe if we were able to know for certain what our purpose was\u2026it would sabotage our ability to accomplish it.\u00a0\u00a0Now another possibility you might arrive at when you ask these questions and are met back with silence\u2026is that maybe\u2026the universe has no meaning\u2026or even if it does\u2026maybe just because of these crude tools these eyes ears and ability to reason\u2026maybe it\u2019s impossible for you to ever discover that meaning with certainty at all.\u00a0\u00a0But you know what? when you\u2019re asking these questions\u2026who really wants to believe all that? I\u2019m not gonna let some existential crisis ruin my day\u2026so you hold out hope! Maybe I DO have a purpose! After all\u2026sure I\u2019m just a human being\u2026but the flip side of that is\u2026I\u2019m just a human being\u2026who am I to make some proclamation about there being no meaning to everything in the universe. So you reserve judgement\u2026keep your eyes peeled for that meaning\u2026and go on with your life\u2026usually with a set of idealistic expectations about how the universe in gonna be treating you\u2026after all\u2026if you DO play some sort of role in the grand scheme of things\u2026easy assumption to make from there is that the universe must have some way to protect that investment.\u00a0\u00a0So you go on throughout your life armed with that set of exceptions keeping your eyes open!\u2026and then\u2026inevitably\u2026the universe smacks you in the face\u2026life happens\u2026your sister gets hit by a car\u2026you don\u2019t get the job that you wanted\u2026these things happen all the time. What we see as horrible tragedies\u2026lives are completely destroyed. Human suffering is visited on a scale that is hard to comprehend. When these things happen to us\u2026and they DO happen just less frequently than they otherwise would because you live in the luxury of the modern world\u2026when these things happen to us\u2026one thing seems clear in that moment\u2026whatever purpose the universe has for you\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem to insure that you\u2019re going to be financially stable\u2026or surrounded by a big family at Thanksgiving\u2026in that moment\u2026the universe seems pretty uninterested in whether you\u2019re going to be happy\u2026in that moment\u2026the universe seems pretty uninterested in you.\u00a0Now Camus says we find ourselves in these moments a lot\u2026especially when we\u2019re young\u2026 And because we\u2019re so desperately trying to find this cosmic meaning to our life that we swear must be out there somewhere\u2026we start to get confused and scared\u2026we start to have this inner monologue. Why is this happening to me? All of this tragedy seems to be so random\u2026I\u2019m not a bad person\u2026why are all these terrible things happening to me and this criminal over there never has anything bad happen to them\u2026maybe the way I act doesn\u2019t have any bearing at all on whether the universe allows some tragic course of events to unfold in my life. Maybe it all is just random\u2026But if that\u2019s true\u2026I still have my original question\u2026what is the meaning of my life?\u00a0Now listening to that inner monologue there\u2026there\u2019s a lot of tension. Tension between expectations that person has about what SHOULD be happening to them and the reality of what actually DID happen to them. Camus would say this tension\u2026tension that he thought we all face at some point and i\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all had a similar inner monologue to the one we just heard at SOME point in our lives\u2026that tension is explained\u2026 by the contrast between the fact that you\u2019re running around searching for some cosmically determined meaning to your life that the universe is going to guarantee for you\u2026when the reality is\u2026the universe doesn\u2019t seem to have a meaning\u2026or at least if it does\u2026we don\u2019t know what it is, and it\u2019s impossible for us to know what it is\u2026at least right at this second.\u00a0\u00a0What this means if this is true\u2026is that all that desire to find some cosmic meaning\u2026all of the anxiety and regret\u2026the pain you feel when you see your loved ones in pain or however the universe decides to smack you in the face at that moment\u2026that is the pain of you rolling the boulder up the hill like Sisyphus and watching the boulder tumble back down to the bottom\u2026all of your efforts for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0See ultimately to Camus\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter how hard you push the boulder\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter how much you agonize over trying to find that cosmic meaning\u2026eventually\u2026you\u2019re gonna die\u2026everyone you've ever known is going to die\u2026your name is gonna be forgotten\u2026Wal Mart is gonna take over the world\u2026the sun is going to inflate and explode and destroy any trace of you that could possibly be left\u2026ultimately, because you didn\u2019t choose to be born\u2026 you have been condemned to a lifetime pushing a boulder up a hill only to find out that it was all pointless. \u00a0\u00a0Now if this sounds pretty ridiculous\u2026this is why Camus describes this existence as \u201cabsurd\u201d. He says:\u00a0\u201cMan stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Now if you\u2019re saying to yourself wow Camus thank you\u2026no no thank you for that wonderful speech\u2026you just made the whole family feel really depressed\u2026you know call me crazy Camus\u2026but I don\u2019t WANT to feel like this\u2026I don\u2019t want to feel like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill for the rest of my life for no reason! .. And he would probably say back, Yeah, No kidding\u2026NO ONE DOES. You\u2019re living in a constant state of absurdity with the universe. But whether you want to acknowledge it right now or just shove your head in the sand\u2026 the fact remains you ARE like Sisyphus\u2026and that uncomfortable feeling that you want to avoid for the rest of your life\u2026EVERYONE ELSE wants to avoid it too! And Camus would say that people have no shortage of creative ways that they\u2019ve come up with over the years\u2026to escape this state of acknowledging the way that things actually are.\u00a0\u00a0Now one of the go to ways that might come to mind is to just, to commit suicide. After all, if you\u2019re condemned to a life of the painful and agonizing work of pushing a boulder up a hill\u2026and you know that all that pain, effort and sacrifice isn\u2019t really leading to anything\u2026why wouldn\u2019t you just cling onto the boulder like a koala baby\u2026and uh\u2026let gravity do the rest. Certainly does solve your problem right? Well Camus would say, no it actually doesn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0Somebody that commits suicide as a response to the absurdity of the world is looking at the problem in a really misguided way. The problem is not with the fact that you\u2019re alive. The TRUE problem is with the disparity between your search for meaning and how the universe doesn\u2019t seem to have one that you can arrive at. If this is truly a problem, any solution to that problem is going to have to do with repairing that disparity. All you\u2019re really doing by committing suicide is running away from the ACTUAL problem. It\u2019s like fixing a leaky faucet by moving to a different house\u2026got news for you\u2026that things still in there drippin.\u00a0\u00a0There must be a better way!\u00a0\u00a0Now I know what you're saying\u2026wow that was it? That was the answer to the most fundamental philosophical question? That was like three sentences! Well no. See because to Camus\u2026that is not the only way that you can commit suicide in this existence. There\u2019s another type of suicide. The one we just talked about is what he called physical suicide\u2026the other kind is what he calls philosophical suicide.\u00a0\u00a0So at the risk of sounding redundant I just wanna reiterate something real quick so you can see just how similar these two types of suicide are to Camus. You find yourself in a state of the absurd\u2026the reality of this world that we live in is that you want to be able to make sense of it and find meaning in it, but you don\u2019t know that meaning, you don\u2019t know how to find that meaning and it may ultimately be either entirely meaningless or impossible for you to ever find the meaning. So when you live in that world\u2026one way to leave that world\u2026 is to commit physical suicide\u2026 but as we just talked about you don\u2019t really solve the problem\u2026the faucet is still leaking inside of your house\u2026you just live in a different house\u2026Now ANOTHER way to leave this world that doesn\u2019t really solve the problem is to commit philosophical suicide\u2026or to focus your attention on some OTHER world that doesn\u2019t actually exist\u2026a world where this anxiety and tension that comes along with the reality of this absurdity no longer exists. This is like living in a house with a leaky faucet\u2026and it\u2019s dripping all day\u2026driving you insane\u2026you can\u2019t sleep because there\u2019s this leaky faucet that\u2019s constantly dripping in your ears\u2026so instead of fixing the faucet you put in earplugs and pretend like faucets don\u2019t actually exist.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the most obvious example of this from human history would be religion, I mean, common to most denominations at least in our modern world\u2026they literally focus their attention on another world, one devoid of anxiety, one that provides meaning to everything you do in your life\u2026 but make no mistake followers of religion are not even close to the only people guilty of philosophical suicide to Camus. Though I think it\u2019s interesting to pause on them for a second to notice something unique about Camus.\u00a0\u00a0Camus uses the word meaningless a lot\u2026but let\u2019s not misunderstand where he\u2019s coming from. Camus doesn\u2019t see himself as some sort of\u2026you know\u2026anti Thomas Aquinas\u2026who\u2019s goes into great detail and writes entire books presenting how he has a philosophical proof of how the universe has no meaning. No, he sort of comes at it from the other side\u2026he just tries to explain the reasons why there is such a huge incentive to create and confer that meaning onto the universe. That state of the absurd is a pretty horrible place\u2026if somebody\u2019s willing to PHYSICALLY commit suicide\u2026Camus would say they\u2019re DEFINITELY going to be willing to adopt some awesome meaning for their lives where they get to live forever\u2026 and then walk around with a confirmation bias.\u00a0\u00a0Now as I said\u2026followers of religion aren\u2019t the only people out there looking to another world to alleviate this feeling of the absurd. What I mean by another world is simply some pre-manufactured system of beliefs that doesn\u2019t really reflect THIS worlds reality\u2026it\u2019s really just an attempt to simplify the world down into terms that are easily understandable so that you don\u2019t have to contend with the true, unbridled ambiguity of it all.\u00a0\u00a0This could be any number of things: nationalism, racism, sexism, your political outlook\u2026even things like watching sports or playing video games with every free second. Again, the goal of committing philosophical suicide is to sort of revel in a state of certainty that somebody else gave you\u2026a state of certainty that doesn\u2019t actually exist so that you can get rid of the uncomfortable feeling of answering those fundamental questions about your existence. Again, it\u2019s putting earplugs in and pretending like faucets don\u2019t exist\u2026and if that\u2019s a funny visual\u2026look around you\u2026most people are doing it right now.\u00a0\u00a0Now for Camus\u2026this runs into the same problem as physical suicide. It doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem\u2026it just deludes you into believing that you already know everything about existence. Now if you\u2019re out there saying, what\u2019s wrong with that? What\u2019s wrong with a little hope Camus?\u00a0\u00a0Hope? Stop hoping\u2026stop looking at some other world that doesn\u2019t exist in a TV screen or a book or in your reductionist view of the way things are\u2026stop looking at that other world and start looking at this one! That hope, that constant looking to some other world robs you of so much in this one. Hope may be calming to that state of absurdity\u2026but think of the cost! It robs us of the here and now. Everything we COULD be experiencing now, but aren\u2019t.\u00a0See Camus didn\u2019t think suicide was the answer to this existential crisis. Physical Suicide and Philosophical Suicide are just two ways of RUNNING from the problem\u2026but Camus thought how bout instead of RUNNING from the problem\u2026you welcome the problem with open arms\u2026you EMBRACE the problem. CHAIN yourself to the problem. Find comfort in the uncomfortable.\u00a0See what Camus thought people that commit philosophical suicide never understood\u2026is that not running from the absurd\u2026but facing your existence head on and acknowledging it\u2026that makes you a pretty amazing person. That\u2019s a pretty awesome accomplishment. How many other people are brave enough to do something like that? And he thinks you should think of it this way\u2026to Camus someone that is able to be aware of the absurd and not run and hide from is known to him as an absurd hero. See because to be aware of the absurd in a strange way is to be superior to it.\u00a0\u00a0Take the absurd head on\u2026stop hoping and looking to another world that may not ever exist and spend your time in the wealth of the here and now\u2026which seems to Camus to be sensory in nature.\u00a0\u00a0Camus talks about enjoying the little things\u2026enjoying the company of family and friends and good food and just sort of appreciating the sensory experience we were given.\u00a0Do things that make you feel good. If you love spending time with your family\u2026enjoy them and appreciate them\u2026because you never know when this disinterested universe is going to take them away\u2026Enjoy your food\u2026you never know when this disinterested universe is going to throw a world wide dustbowl our way and you\u2019ll be fighting to the death for a bag of peanuts.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, maybe we ARE like Sisyphus\u2026maybe nothing we do will ever live on eternally and maybe all the anxiety and regret and hard work we put into this life ultimately has no meaning. But the Gods only condemned Sisyphus to push the boulder\u2026they didn\u2019t condemn him to resent the process. Camus says we should imagine Sisyphus smiling while pushing the boulder\u2026understanding the ultimate futility of his efforts, but enjoying it anyway as much as he can.\u00a0\u00a0This is a model of how we should live our lives. You don\u2019t have to hate or run away from the absurd\u2026you can embrace it and smile anyway. Imagine if you were 13 years old again and your parents grounded you for staying out too late\u2026the only reason that punishment works is because you hate the idea of being grounded, the only reason your parents use it is precisely BECAUSE you don't like it. I mean, how much sense would it make for your parents to say you're grounded\u2026go to Disneyland! It wouldn\u2019t work. Imagine enjoying every second of being grounded. Wouldn\u2019t have been that bad! This is what we have to do with the absurd\u2026push our meaningless boulder, but smile and enjoy it as much as we possibly can.\u00a0\u00a0Now the last two episodes have been on Sartre and Camus\u2026two people that for part of their life were practically best friends and for the other part of their life were worst enemies. The next episode is going to be on one of the most famous back and forth debates in the history of the world\u2026between Sartre and Camus. Thank you for listening\u2026I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0"
