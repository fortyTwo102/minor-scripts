    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #121 on Michel Foucault. Check out the episode page HERE.So real quick just to clarify something: towards the end of last episode I talked about doing a couple episodes on the late work of Wittengenstein and Heidegger...uh, but based on the emails I received after releasing last episode, it seems clear that people don't really want to hear about it, they just want to move on to Postmodernism. Now, personally, I think to fully understand Postmodernism it's absolutely crucial to understand this transition from Logical Positivism to the mid 20th century where there is more of a focus on Behaviourism and Pragmatism, but look let's be honest here, at the end of the day I'm a dancing monkey making episodes about what the majority of people want to hear or else I go out of business...so with that in mind, today's episode is part one of a series on Michel Foucault...and if you're at all confused about any of the context of these ideas that are being brought up, send me an email, I'll respond to as many of them as I can.\u00a0But that said, if someone were going to write a shortlist of the quintessential, Postmodernist philosophers...of what is meant when someone says Postmodernist philosopher: Foucault is definitely going to be on that list. But to some...relegating the work of Foucault and labeling it as merely being in the realm of philosophy...doesn't really do him justice...because his work often times moves into areas that have nothing to DO with philosophy...to some you could easily refer to Foucault as a historian, or a political theorist, or a social commentator...depending on what era of his life he wrote the book you're reading, you could have very different impressions about what subject matters were important to him. This makes it completely impossible for us to cover the entire scope of Foucault's work in a single episode, and it can make it kind of hard to find a clean entry point into covering his work... but I think a really good place to start is for us to talk about the details of his 1975 book titled Discipline and Punish.\u00a0Now, to a total outsider to the work of Michel Foucault... to someone who just picked up and read Discipline and Punish one day...the book may seem to be just a history of criminology...a historical catalogue of the ways we've treated and punished criminals over the centuries. But as we'll talk about later on today's episode, Foucault is actually making a much deeper point with this book...he's making a point about the structures of where power lies and the relationship between the people in power and the average citizen...and just so the first half of the podcast doesn't COMPLETELY come off as me doing a documentary about the history of how we've treated prisoners...I want to ask some questions throughout the episode the sort of foreshadow to why this may be much bigger than just Foucault going over the history of this stuff.\u00a0By the way, Foucault himself would never describe this book as a \"history\" of anything. Foucault hated the word history and almost never used it in his writing. He used words to describe this book more like, a geneology of the way we've treated criminals, or an archaeology of how criminals have been punished over the years. He hates the word history...because so often the word history brings with it a connotation... that we exist in our modern world at the end of this long historical timeline of events that have led to near constant progress. This idea that, hey, we used to be these barbaric savages that followed the playbook of Machievelli, the ends justify the means, we used to believe that it was morally acceptable for the king or the people in power to brutally torture and kill someone that was guilty of a heinous crime...but then HISTORY happened. Time went on...progress was made. Great political theorists came along...great leaders, great ethical philosophers did their work and we all realized the error of our ways and brought into existence a more modern world where everyone is much more free...the people in power inhibiting the lives of the average citizen far less than they used to . Foucault is going to call this assumption about history into question and really dig deeper into the idea of: how much has really changed when it comes to the fundamental relationship between those in power and the citizens?\u00a0Foucault begins exploring this idea in chapter one of Discipline and Punish by laying the groundwork for the discussion, and describing what it was like to be a criminal in Western Europe in the 1750's. Specifically he gives an example of what the world was like at this time... by describing an actual punishment that was carried out on a criminal in the year 1757. Listen to the punishment this person faced for the crimes they had committed...this punishment was to be implemented in public, on the steps of the church and the criminal was to be:\u00a0\"taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing but a shirt, holding a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds\"; then, on a scaffold that will be erected there, the flesh will be torn from his breasts, arms, thighs and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be torn away, poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax and sulphur melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes and his ashes thrown to the winds\"\u00a0That was an actual punishment carried out on an actual person in the year 1757. Now, a few things Foucault would want us to initially consider about this situation: one would be to recognize the fact... that this sentence was handed down on what may as well be a distant alien planet to the planet that you live on. See, because it's so easy to hear about a punishment like this...weigh it up against the moral intuitions that happened to be given to you in modern times...feel morally superior to the people that lived in the 1750's and then write off their entire culture as just barbaric savagery from a bygone era that to even talk about is legitimizing a waste of time. What could we possibly learn from people that thought something like this was a good idea? But the problem with this approach to Foucault is that if you always end the conversation here, number 1. you never understand the\u00a0historical context that explains why things were different back then...but number two, and more importantly to Foucault, that feeling of moral superiority often times gets us to never consider the similarities between the world back then and the world as it is now, more specifically the power structures of that time, their relationship to the citizens and how many aspects of them still persist to this day.\u00a0Because think about it: this punishment was handed down in a world that was pre-American revolution, pre-French revolution. The nation-state that sentenced this prisoner to this punishment was not modeled after the Enlightenment, it was modeled more after a Rennaisance era interpretation of Machievelli's The Prince and Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. The stability of this particular society would have been grounded in social contract theory...or if you remember from the podcast episodes we did about this period, the idea that upon birth, every citizen of the nation-state effectively signs a social contract...the citizens sacrifice a certain amount to the state by way of taxation or public service or by other means, and in return they receive protection...protection from what Hobbes calls the State of Nature, protection by a King or a Magistrate or whatever sovereign body is in charge that guarantees certain natural rights for people. Put another way: the citizen's job is to sacrifice for the sovereign, so that the sovereign can do their job of guaranteeing the natural rights of the population, INCLUDING punishing criminals that disobey the law. This is a contract where BOTH parties have very important roles if society is going to function.\u00a0\u00a0Now another thing you may remember from the episodes we did on Hobbes...is that when somebody commits a crime in one of these societies, the act is seen as a direct attack on the body politic. Not only that, but the crime is seen as a direct affront to every single citizen that has signed a social contract, each one of them making up a small piece of that Leviathan that Hobbes describes...but more importantly than either of those two things, when a crime is committed in one of these societies it is seen as a direct affront... to the authority, of the king...and it's RIGHT here, Foucault thinks, that you can start to see the true, primary function of the penal system in one of these societies in the 1750's.\u00a0The goal of the criminal justice system back then was not justice...there was no real focus on a balancing of the scales in any sort of way. The goal of implementing the punishment wasn't fairness...people didn't get the same punishment for the same crime generally speaking. The true function of the criminal justice system, the REASON these punishments were often dramatic and ALWAYS carried out in front of everyone in public as a spectacle, the primary function was its ability to maintain social order, and it achieved this goal in a couple of key ways: first of all... this type of system was a fantastic deterrent of criminal behavior...because if you were someone who had plans that day of committing some sort of heinous criminal act...look no further than the guy getting his arms ripped off by red hot pincers as a persuasive essay as to why you shouldn't be doing that stuff. But the other reason this type of system was so good... beCAUSE in one of these societies, when a crime is committed it directly calls into question the authority of the sovereign...these punishments being carried out in front of everybody on the church steps...ended up being an extremely useful public spectacle...because these punishments served as reinforcement of the fact...direct evidence OF the fact...that the sovereign was still upholding their end of the social contract.\u00a0The primary goal of this entire display was not justice, it was not fairness...it was the maintaining of order within the society... and Foucault would want to point out that if you're the sovereign... if you're the person or group that's been commissioned by one of these societies to maintain order... an absolutely crucial part of doing your job is to make sure that you're still in power, able to maintain order tomorrow, or next week, or a month from now. In other words, Foucault is saying: an intrinsic, necessary part of that task of maintaining order, if you're the sovereign, is preserving the existing power structure. But to ask a foreshadowing question here: what happens when the power structure no longer serves the needs of the people?\u00a0Now, Foucault would want to point out that not only did having a sovereign whose job it was to maintain order in this way... work for us...but it worked well. In fact, it worked EXTREMELY well for hundreds of years...but... eventually, as is the case with ANY imperfect system, the sovereign and other people in positions of power started to notice some patterns with societies that were structured this way and how they rise and fall...they started to run into some unintended consequences... flaws in the system that seemed to be repeating themselves over and over again. See, because when you're in the business of publicly executing people for the sake of sending a message about where the power lies in a society...things don't always play out seamlessly.\u00a0For example, sometimes... when you try to publicly execute someone...they don't die. SOMETHING's eventually gonna go wrong...the equipment malfunctions...the horses aren't cooperating that day...you try to hang someone but they have like a six pack on their neck and they just kinda hang there for a few hours laughing at you. Point is: these sorts of things happened sometimes...and when they did it wasn't a far leap for the population to start considering whether this was some sort of bad omen...was this a sign that the authority of the sovereign was wavering...that they were no longer capable of carrying out their end of the social contract?\u00a0But this isn't the only unintended consequence that started to crop up in these societies. For example, at the beginning of the episode we talked about a pretty extreme punishment in 1757 that Foucault cites in chapter one of Discipline and Punish. Well it wasn't entirely uncommon when one of THESE sorts of punishments were carried out on someone... that the population might think that the punishment greatly exceeded the severity of the crime that was committed. When this sort of thing happened, it wasn't entirely uncommon for the population to side with the criminal...or at the very least call into question the authority of the sovereign and whether they're still running things properly.\u00a0But probably the biggest unintended negative consequence for the sovereign that NOBODY saw coming...was that when you have these brutal executions and punishments taking place in the public square every day in front of every one...when society's functioning well and the sovereign is doing their job...there is zero doubt in ANYONE'S mind when it comes to who is in charge. There is zero question as to who you'll have to answer to and how you'll have to answer to them should you decide to go against the rules enforced by the existing power structure. But the flip side to that...is that when things are NOT going well...say there's a famine...or Natural Rights aren't being guaranteed, or even if there's just a public sentiment that the sovereign is inept and some change needs to take place...the flip side is that there is zero confusion in anyone's mind when looking for the people in power that need to be overthrown and killed for this change to occur.\u00a0What the sovereign and the people in power started to realize... is that in this type of society that we're talking about, brutal as it was, the will of the people often had influence over which people were in positions of power...and this could be EXTREMELY inconvenient for the sovereign at times...it made staying in a position of power for any extended period of time a pretty vulnerable enterprise. The people in positions of power knew that something drastic had to change if they wanted to make power more sustainable...and Foucault documents a fundamental shift that occurs in the way societies treat criminals that takes place between the years 1757 and 1837.\u00a0Now, real quick, I'm just anticipating a place that someone's brain might go here: oh, so what you're saying is that a bunch of evil people in positions of power realized that in this older type of society the will of the people ACTUALLY had some influence could throw them OUT of positions of power...so they all got together, met in back rooms, formed a secret society, called it something like the council of the drifting phoenix where they had some creepy secret handshake and they all sat around coming up with ways to control the population so they'd never have to relinquish power. But what Foucault would probably want to point out is that there doesn't need to be some evil secret society for people in government to want power to be more deeply embedded. Remember, the people in positions of power signed a social contract as well. Part of that social contract is maintaining the order of society so that they can continue to guarantee the natural rights of the citizens, and part of maintaining order historically, to Foucault, has been to preserve the existing power structure. There doesn't need to be a single, evil person in any of these positions of power for them to be motivated to come up with new, better tactics to stay in power....and Foucault would say these new tactics that are being implemented between the years 1757 and 1837...is a broader evolution of the way people in power keep prisoners under control.\u00a0These changes occur gradually...over the course of decades...sometimes just with subtle changes to the ceremony of the public execution itself. Whereas before prisoners used to just be paraded around in an open top cart before their execution...slowly over the years that evolved into a closed top cart with wooden planks that you could hardly see the person through...that eventually evolved into a bag being over the person's head and their identity completely concealed. By the 1790's, most societies had moved away from these dramatic or creative public executions and favored the more standardized punishment of a guillotine in front of the courthouse...few years later the guillotine was moved behind the courthouse...until eventually it was moved inside the prison and all the executions were done in private. Punishment...and the reality of the way we treat criminals...has slowly moved from before when it was something that was at the forefront of public consciousness that it was impossible not to be aware of...to now, when it is something abstract, silent, cordoned off and even locked away in these distant far away buildings that we never have to see. To ask a couple more foreshadowing questions: what sort of effects might that have on a society...and more importantly why might people who want to maintain their positions of power prefer a situation like this?\u00a0By the year 1837, two fundamental changes had occurred in the way we punish criminals that Foucault says are extremely deliberate. Number one: putting somebody to death as a public spectacle that everybody gets to witness had all but disappeared. And number two: we had changed tactics from punishing criminals by inflicting harm on their bodies...to the emergence of a new era in our methods of punishing criminals where now we focused primarily on the disciplining and control of their minds. There is a fundamental shift from physical punishment of the person's body...to the disciplining and reformation of the person's mind. This is why Foucault titles the book Discipline and Punish...this is the emergence and infancy of what will eventually become the modern prison...this is the beginning of an evolution where people in positions of power develop a much more efficient and effective way of wielding and sustaining power over people.\u00a0Foucault cites an actual strict schedule that criminals in the 1830's serving time had to follow during their time in prison. You can imagine what something like this might look like: 7am wake up. 7:05 you are to be on your mark for roll call. 7:15 you are to be at the mess hall for breakfast. 7:25 you are to be at your assigned job post for the day. 9:15 water break, 9:20 back to work...in other words: when your ENTIRE day is scheduled and accounted for down to the second...there's not much time for illicit criminal activity. There's not much time for ANY thought outside of disciplining yourself and adhering to this schedule of stuff you're required to do. Well couple this new, strict focus on the disciplining of the mind and reformation of behavior with MORE new tactics that were emerging over the years...more specifically a new, improved, three pronged approach towards controlling prisoners that Foucault thinks is one of the most effective methods that has ever been devised.\u00a0The three...prongs...of this three pronged method that is used to keep prisoners in line...are what Foucault calls: Surveillence, Normalization, and Examination. That is...Constant surveillance of the prisoners...which combines nicely with normalization...or a normalized standard of how a good prisoner should be thinking and behaving that has been given to you by the people in power...and both of these work nicely with a constant process of examination and re-examination where people in positions of power give you a score or a grade determining how well you're corresponding with that way of behaving that we've decided a good prisoner should be a reflection of.\u00a0Foucault thinks this new, highly effective way of controlling prisoners may have sprung out of the work of a philosopher named Jeremy Bentham. The same way Plato in The Republic spends a considerable amount of time trying to come up with the ideal structure of government...Jeremy Bentham spends a bunch of time in HIS work trying to come up with the ideal structure of a prison. The model that he arrives at after thinking about it for so long is what he calls The Panopticon. Simply put, the Panopticon is a building designed and laid out in a clever way, where a single guard, or a warden or anyone in a position of power can stand in a specific spot in the center...and THEY can see inside of the cell of any prisoner they want... but the prisoners can't see them, they can't know WHEN they're being watched, they can't know the criteria that determines WHY they're being watched...in a sense, Bentham says, the reason this is an ideal design for a prison...is because the only reasonable thing the prisoners can do in a prison that's designed this way...is to behave every second of every day as though they're being watched...because they can never know when or when its not happening. Their lives become, once again, constant surveillance through cameras or armed guards, strict adherence to a normalized \"way a good prisoner behaves\" given to them by the people in power, and rigorous examination by experts, or the court system or the parole board or whoever it is THIS WEEK for the prisoner to answer to.\u00a0Now some of you out there might be thinking: why are we going on so much about the history of criminals? What does this have to do with philosophy? What relevance does this have to me whatsoever? Well, if you're someone that's thought that all we've been talking about so far on this episode are methods we've developed over the years for controlling... only prisoners...Foucault would probably say I hope you've been paying attention to the details of what's been said so far...because when Jeremy Bentham sits down and creates the design of this Panopticon of his...hes not just talking about the ideal structure of a prison...and what follows from that is that Foucault is NOT JUST talking about the evolution of methods that we've developed to control prisoners.\u00a0Jeremy Bentham describes the Panopticon very generally in his work\u00a0as \"a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example\"...and knowing that...it makes sense that he quickly goes on to say that although this is the ideal structure of a\u00a0prison if you wanted to control prisoners...there's no reason why this same design couldn't be applied if you wanted to create, you know, a mental institution that promotes a standard to the inmates of what a good patient is...or in a military setting promoting what it is to be a good soldier...or in a university setting promoting how you should think and behave if you want to be a good student...if Bentham lived in a modern economic society he no doubt would see the utility of the Panopticon if it was applied to a factory and producing good factory workers...or even more generally how it could be used at a multi-national corporation trying to produce good employees.\u00a0See, that's the thing. Let's say you're in a position of power in a corporation...to be able to use the fundamentals of these highly effective tactics that have been developed over the years to control your employees, you don't need to treat them like they're a prisoner that's part of a chain gang forced to crush rocks all day...no, as long as you make sure that their chain is long enough that they don't FEEL like a prisoner...you can set up some pretty narrow parameters for what it is to be a \"good employee\" that not only will they fall into...but they will actually police themselves to stay that way...they'll feel intense pressure to adhere to that normalized standard of behavior at all times, because their life at work is one of surveillance, normalization and examination. Surveillance by way of cameras, time clocks, supervisors, deadlines, monitoring activity on your computer, even sometimes just the surveillance of other employees around that feel like they benefit from having dirt on someone in a highly competitive environment. The normalized standard of being a good employee...speaking, acting and dressing in a professional way, however that's defined by whoever in the company. Putting on your work persona...always being politically correct...doing all the things to make sure you're a good team player. Then it's on to the examination phase with your monthly, quarterly, yearly evaluations where they give you a score out of ten in different areas to determine how well your doing...or in other words how well you correspond with exactly who I say you should be. Your productivity is about the same level as last evaluation...you're doing good in some areas...but there's room for improvement in a couple other areas and don't worry...I made an action plan so that we can see if we can get you back on track. This three pronged method... has become the dominant way of controlling human behavior...and if you doubt that in any way...consider the similarities it has to the structure of some religions with the constant surveillance, normative behavior and rigorous process of examination. This method is so effective... and so capable of being applied to any circumstance imaginable...that in our modern world it has so pervaded the way power is exercised that it extends beyond institutions like prisons or corporations and it has embedded itself into the very fabric of society. The very same process of surveillance, normalization and examination could be said to exist in the way you present yourself online...the media you consume...it most likely is even being played out in various social circles that you're a part of right now. Foucault would say one of the truly insidious things about the way power is wielded and people are controlled in modern times with these new methods, is that simultaneously you are both a subject that is being controlled while also being an active participant in the system...an active participant that in some way, most times unknowingly, supports the existing power structure.\u00a0Let's slow down for a second and really talk about what is being implied here for Foucault. Remember the criminal justice system back in the 1750's? So as we talked about the goal of the whole situation back then was clearly not primarily justice or fairness...but instead the benefits the system provided to society when it came to maintaining order and keeping things moving forward. Well Foucault is going to ask: is the penal system of the 1970's really so different when you take a closer look at it? Do we exist in a modern, enlightened era where we've grown throughout history and learned the error of our ways and constructed a penal system that first and foremost has the aim of distributing justice and fairness? To Foucault, the goal of the modern penal system is not justice or fairness...\u0016the goal is through surveillance, normalization and examination to produce harmless, non-rebellious, working, tax-paying productive citizens who follow the rules and are satisfied with a life of conforming to the normalized standard of what it is to be a person handed down to them from above...in other words, docile, useful subjects that carry out the vision for what the future should hold given to them by the people in power.\u00a0This is why there is such a difference when it comes to sentencing between white collar and blue collar crimes. Between an executive that robs the IRS of $20,000 by evading taxes...and some dude that robs a Taco Bell of $85 bucks and a burrito supreme.\u00a0Short of the executive absolutely refusing to pay back the money...9 times out of 10 they are not going to see the inside of a prison cell because their behavior...doesn't really need much reformation in the eyes of the people in power. Keep doing almost everything you're doing...keep working, keep creating jobs, keep starting new companies and going to badminton on Sundays...just pay your taxes. Whereas the guy that robbed the Taco Bell...it doesn't matter if he marches back into the store...hands over the 85 bucks directly to the manager...baby birds the burrito supreme back into his mouth...9 times out of 10 that guy is going to jail because the goal of the penal system is reforming criminals to fit a pre-existing mold of what a normal person is.\u00a0Also consider the fact...that once you're sentenced...it isn't about justice or fairness or some sort of direct punishment and retribution for the crimes you committed at that point either...in today's day and age there's the modern advent of getting out on good behavior. In other words, as long as you're willing to reform yourself into the type of person that we've told you to be...it doesn't really matter what your initial sentence was...we may knock a couple decades off your sentence if you're willing to play by our rules.\u00a0Now\u00a0some people...no matter how many times they go to prison...are just the type of people that are never going to play by the rules. They're never going to become this person the people in power want them to become...they're never going to change... and those people are the people that will either be lifelong repeat offenders in and out of jail...or they will eventually get life in prison.\u00a0And Foucault would say that it's these kinds of people that refuse to play by the rules that are absolutely fascinating to us as \"normal\" people. That's another modern invention for Foucault...thinking of ourselves as normal and the labeling of criminals as \"abnormal\" or people that need to be reformed to a state of normalcy. But its the fact that they're not like normal people that makes us so fascinated by criminals! Look at the thousands of True Crime podcasts that have exploded onto the podcast scene in the past couple years. Massively popular. Look on Netflix at all the crime related shows there are. If you still have a TV subscription, look at all the shows on the air documenting some crime that was committed. This fascination is not a modern phenomena to Foucault...this has existed all throughout our history. In the American West, there was Billy the Kid. In the Great Depression, Bonnie and Clyde. Criminals can even become folk heroes like DB Cooper, but this doesn't just happen in the United States...this has happened all over the world. Part of the reason these older societies moved away from the direction of executing criminals as a public spectacle...is because of the very real effects of what happens when you put a criminal beloved by the public at center stage. Foucault thinks we love criminals so much because when they vehemently refuse to play by the rules of society...they have an ability to show us exactly what we are.\u00a0The law-abiding, occupants and active participants in what is effectively a massive social prison. We live our lives trapped in a cell inside of a Panopticon. Or a Panopticon inside of ANOTHER Panopticon. In fact, the Panopticon is a great metaphor for the entire project of modernity, to Foucault. See just like in the actual prison...where the goal of the operation is not some higher virtue like justice, but instead to reform prisoners into subjects that are useful for keeping society going...we, as occupants of our social prison, are constantly being disciplined and reformed into good employees, good consumers, good voters, good students, good friends..all internalized expectations of ourselves given to us by someone in a position of power. We're given standards by TV shows, movies, books, all media...standards we internalize that tell us how our bodies should look, what beauty is, what you should care about, what you can say and can't say, what some people can do that you can't do, there is no prison or method of torture that has ever been devised that can do to people what they willingly do to themselves in our modern social prison.\u00a0We live in a Panopticon, because we live our lives as though we are constantly being watched and held to these standards about how we should be that are given to us by media. But the truly sick part about it is that we have constructed a world where we are simultaneously... the prisoner being reformed in the cell, AND the warden at the center of the Panopticon that's constantly watching us. We've created a world where we are under constant surveillance by ourselves. Surveillence by looking in the mirror...wondering if you should starve yourself tonight to lose that two pounds that will make you beautiful. Surveillance of your own irrational, toxic thoughts, but you suffer in silence rather than have to face the shame of asking for help and appearing weak to the people around you who NEED you to keep it together. There is no prison that can compare to a life of forcing yourself to adhere to a normalized standard of behavior that tells you the person you should be while constantly being surveyed and examined by yourself and others to make sure you stay that way. This is what Foucault refers to as the geneology of the modern soul.\u00a0Consider the fact that the media you consume even gives you the very vocabulary you have at your disposal, and with it the only categories you have to think about who you even are as a person. THINK ABOUT THAT. Think about the power you could have if you were the person that came up with the only terms people had to\u00a0think about who they even are.\u00a0See all throughout history people have asked the questions: where does power ultimately lie? Who has the power and how is it exercised on people? And there's this classic idea that people have brought up that power lies in the hands of people that are in privileged political positions. The thinking is that if you are the president...you can pass executive orders, you can go across the aisle and find bi-partisan consensus, you can appoint judges that ultimately dictate the law...that is where power lies. But then a Marxist tradition came along and said, no...that's actually a naive understanding of power...because in advanced economic societies...if you can buy the interests of the president...if you can lobby politicians and get legislation influenced in your favor because of financial contributions...then it's not people in privileged political positions that have the power, but people in privileged economic positions. Well, many postmodernists would say, Foucault among them, that the Marxists are just as naive as the people that came before them, and just as hellbent on trying to find some grand narrative to explain everything like they try to do with economics. To Foucault, power doesn't lie in either of these places. See it would be great if power actually did lie in the hands of a relative few like that...to Foucault, it'd be great if something like the illuminati really existed because then, just like in the societies in the 1750's, we could point directly at the people in power and do away with them if things were going bad. But in our modern world, power is much more difficult to identify, and part of the reason is because it has become much more widespread and diffuse. Power, in our modern world to Foucault, is always connected to knowledge. And having recently talked about structuralists and post-structuralists and their views on knowledge claims, we know that knowledge to them is not some objective, codified set of facts about the way the universe is...knowledge to these thinkers is nothing more than the findings of the current, dominant set of cultural discourses and the method that it uses to chop up and make sense of the world.\u00a0So if power lies in the hands of people with knowledge...and knowledge is given to us by people that use narrow, cultural biases to chop up reality...then where do we get our knowledge? And who are these people that arrive at knowledge for us? Well, Science is where we get our knowledge in modern times...and thought leaders within the sciences in their respective fields of study are the people that arrive at knowledge for us to use.\u00a0THIS is where power ultimately lies. You know, Foucault has a famous idea: that man is a recent invention that's reaching its expiration date...that the concept of \"man\" is something that wasn't even talked about until around the 1600's...and part of what he means when he says that is that it wasn't until the 1600's that people really focused on the human sciences as a prescriptive endeavor...it wasn't until the 1600's that fields like psychology, biology, medicine, sociology were being used to try to arrive at a scientific rational idea of \"what it is to be a human being\". Foucault would ask: well who have conducted these experiments that are determining \"what it is to be a human being\"? Have we maybe limited ourselves by only looking at what it is to be a human being from the extremely narrow cultural perspective of almost entirely...men, from a western european cultural background, from a similar educational background, from a similar socio-economic situation where they were able to go to school, get funding for their experiments and were able to think about stuff like this for their entire lives...Foucault would ask: when it comes to our understanding of what it is to be a human being, has the data we've gathered over the years come from such a limited point of view...that much of our understanding of what it is to be a human being is approaching some sort of expiration date?\u00a0Regardless of your answer to this question: Foucault's point about power is that it doesn't matter how much money you have or how high of a political office you hold...those people may SEEM to be powerful...but if you can dictate the parameters that those people use to understand the most foundational things about their existence...if you can dictate their views on what a human being is...how they fit into the world, the vocabulary they use to think about who they are, how about being able to dictate what things even matter to them that they should then use their economic or political resources to pursue in this world...THAT'S where true power lies, to Foucault.So real quick just to clarify something: towards the end of last episode I talked about doing a couple episodes on the late work of Wittengenstein and Heidegger...uh, but based on the emails I received after releasing last episode, it seems clear that people don't really want to hear about it, they just want to move on to Postmodernism. Now, personally, I think to fully understand Postmodernism it's absolutely crucial to understand this transition from Logical Positivism to the mid 20th century where there is more of a focus on Behaviourism and Pragmatism, but look let's be honest here, at the end of the day I'm a dancing monkey making episodes about what the majority of people want to hear or else I go out of business...so with that in mind, today's episode is part one of a series on Michel Foucault...and if you're at all confused about any of the context of these ideas that are being brought up, send me an email, I'll respond to as many of them as I can.\u00a0But that said, if someone were going to write a shortlist of the quintessential, Postmodernist philosophers...of what is meant when someone says Postmodernist philosopher: Foucault is definitely going to be on that list. But to some...relegating the work of Foucault and labeling it as merely being in the realm of philosophy...doesn't really do him justice...because his work often times moves into areas that have nothing to DO with philosophy...to some you could easily refer to Foucault as a historian, or a political theorist, or a social commentator...depending on what era of his life he wrote the book you're reading, you could have very different impressions about what subject matters were important to him. This makes it completely impossible for us to cover the entire scope of Foucault's work in a single episode, and it can make it kind of hard to find a clean entry point into covering his work... but I think a really good place to start is for us to talk about the details of his 1975 book titled Discipline and Punish.\u00a0Now, to a total outsider to the work of Michel Foucault... to someone who just picked up and read Discipline and Punish one day...the book may seem to be just a history of criminology...a historical catalogue of the ways we've treated and punished criminals over the centuries. But as we'll talk about later on today's episode, Foucault is actually making a much deeper point with this book...he's making a point about the structures of where power lies and the relationship between the people in power and the average citizen...and just so the first half of the podcast doesn't COMPLETELY come off as me doing a documentary about the history of how we've treated prisoners...I want to ask some questions throughout the episode the sort of foreshadow to why this may be much bigger than just Foucault going over the history of this stuff.\u00a0By the way, Foucault himself would never describe this book as a \"history\" of anything. Foucault hated the word history and almost never used it in his writing. He used words to describe this book more like, a geneology of the way we've treated criminals, or an archaeology of how criminals have been punished over the years. He hates the word history...because so often the word history brings with it a connotation... that we exist in our modern world at the end of this long historical timeline of events that have led to near constant progress. This idea that, hey, we used to be these barbaric savages that followed the playbook of Machievelli, the ends justify the means, we used to believe that it was morally acceptable for the king or the people in power to brutally torture and kill someone that was guilty of a heinous crime...but then HISTORY happened. Time went on...progress was made. Great political theorists came along...great leaders, great ethical philosophers did their work and we all realized the error of our ways and brought into existence a more modern world where everyone is much more free...the people in power inhibiting the lives of the average citizen far less than they used to . Foucault is going to call this assumption about history into question and really dig deeper into the idea of: how much has really changed when it comes to the fundamental relationship between those in power and the citizens?\u00a0Foucault begins exploring this idea in chapter one of Discipline and Punish by laying the groundwork for the discussion, and describing what it was like to be a criminal in Western Europe in the 1750's. Specifically he gives an example of what the world was like at this time... by describing an actual punishment that was carried out on a criminal in the year 1757. Listen to the punishment this person faced for the crimes they had committed...this punishment was to be implemented in public, on the steps of the church and the criminal was to be:\u00a0\"taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing but a shirt, holding a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds\"; then, on a scaffold that will be erected there, the flesh will be torn from his breasts, arms, thighs and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be torn away, poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax and sulphur melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes and his ashes thrown to the winds\"\u00a0That was an actual punishment carried out on an actual person in the year 1757. Now, a few things Foucault would want us to initially consider about this situation: one would be to recognize the fact... that this sentence was handed down on what may as well be a distant alien planet to the planet that you live on. See, because it's so easy to hear about a punishment like this...weigh it up against the moral intuitions that happened to be given to you in modern times...feel morally superior to the people that lived in the 1750's and then write off their entire culture as just barbaric savagery from a bygone era that to even talk about is legitimizing a waste of time. What could we possibly learn from people that thought something like this was a good idea? But the problem with this approach to Foucault is that if you always end the conversation here, number 1. you never understand the\u00a0historical context that explains why things were different back then...but number two, and more importantly to Foucault, that feeling of moral superiority often times gets us to never consider the similarities between the world back then and the world as it is now, more specifically the power structures of that time, their relationship to the citizens and how many aspects of them still persist to this day.\u00a0Because think about it: this punishment was handed down in a world that was pre-American revolution, pre-French revolution. The nation-state that sentenced this prisoner to this punishment was not modeled after the Enlightenment, it was modeled more after a Rennaisance era interpretation of Machievelli's The Prince and Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. The stability of this particular society would have been grounded in social contract theory...or if you remember from the podcast episodes we did about this period, the idea that upon birth, every citizen of the nation-state effectively signs a social contract...the citizens sacrifice a certain amount to the state by way of taxation or public service or by other means, and in return they receive protection...protection from what Hobbes calls the State of Nature, protection by a King or a Magistrate or whatever sovereign body is in charge that guarantees certain natural rights for people. Put another way: the citizen's job is to sacrifice for the sovereign, so that the sovereign can do their job of guaranteeing the natural rights of the population, INCLUDING punishing criminals that disobey the law. This is a contract where BOTH parties have very important roles if society is going to function.\u00a0\u00a0Now another thing you may remember from the episodes we did on Hobbes...is that when somebody commits a crime in one of these societies, the act is seen as a direct attack on the body politic. Not only that, but the crime is seen as a direct affront to every single citizen that has signed a social contract, each one of them making up a small piece of that Leviathan that Hobbes describes...but more importantly than either of those two things, when a crime is committed in one of these societies it is seen as a direct affront... to the authority, of the king...and it's RIGHT here, Foucault thinks, that you can start to see the true, primary function of the penal system in one of these societies in the 1750's.\u00a0The goal of the criminal justice system back then was not justice...there was no real focus on a balancing of the scales in any sort of way. The goal of implementing the punishment wasn't fairness...people didn't get the same punishment for the same crime generally speaking. The true function of the criminal justice system, the REASON these punishments were often dramatic and ALWAYS carried out in front of everyone in public as a spectacle, the primary function was its ability to maintain social order, and it achieved this goal in a couple of key ways: first of all... this type of system was a fantastic deterrent of criminal behavior...because if you were someone who had plans that day of committing some sort of heinous criminal act...look no further than the guy getting his arms ripped off by red hot pincers as a persuasive essay as to why you shouldn't be doing that stuff. But the other reason this type of system was so good... beCAUSE in one of these societies, when a crime is committed it directly calls into question the authority of the sovereign...these punishments being carried out in front of everybody on the church steps...ended up being an extremely useful public spectacle...because these punishments served as reinforcement of the fact...direct evidence OF the fact...that the sovereign was still upholding their end of the social contract.\u00a0The primary goal of this entire display was not justice, it was not fairness...it was the maintaining of order within the society... and Foucault would want to point out that if you're the sovereign... if you're the person or group that's been commissioned by one of these societies to maintain order... an absolutely crucial part of doing your job is to make sure that you're still in power, able to maintain order tomorrow, or next week, or a month from now. In other words, Foucault is saying: an intrinsic, necessary part of that task of maintaining order, if you're the sovereign, is preserving the existing power structure. But to ask a foreshadowing question here: what happens when the power structure no longer serves the needs of the people?\u00a0Now, Foucault would want to point out that not only did having a sovereign whose job it was to maintain order in this way... work for us...but it worked well. In fact, it worked EXTREMELY well for hundreds of years...but... eventually, as is the case with ANY imperfect system, the sovereign and other people in positions of power started to notice some patterns with societies that were structured this way and how they rise and fall...they started to run into some unintended consequences... flaws in the system that seemed to be repeating themselves over and over again. See, because when you're in the business of publicly executing people for the sake of sending a message about where the power lies in a society...things don't always play out seamlessly.\u00a0For example, sometimes... when you try to publicly execute someone...they don't die. SOMETHING's eventually gonna go wrong...the equipment malfunctions...the horses aren't cooperating that day...you try to hang someone but they have like a six pack on their neck and they just kinda hang there for a few hours laughing at you. Point is: these sorts of things happened sometimes...and when they did it wasn't a far leap for the population to start considering whether this was some sort of bad omen...was this a sign that the authority of the sovereign was wavering...that they were no longer capable of carrying out their end of the social contract?\u00a0But this isn't the only unintended consequence that started to crop up in these societies. For example, at the beginning of the episode we talked about a pretty extreme punishment in 1757 that Foucault cites in chapter one of Discipline and Punish. Well it wasn't entirely uncommon when one of THESE sorts of punishments were carried out on someone... that the population might think that the punishment greatly exceeded the severity of the crime that was committed. When this sort of thing happened, it wasn't entirely uncommon for the population to side with the criminal...or at the very least call into question the authority of the sovereign and whether they're still running things properly.\u00a0But probably the biggest unintended negative consequence for the sovereign that NOBODY saw coming...was that when you have these brutal executions and punishments taking place in the public square every day in front of every one...when society's functioning well and the sovereign is doing their job...there is zero doubt in ANYONE'S mind when it comes to who is in charge. There is zero question as to who you'll have to answer to and how you'll have to answer to them should you decide to go against the rules enforced by the existing power structure. But the flip side to that...is that when things are NOT going well...say there's a famine...or Natural Rights aren't being guaranteed, or even if there's just a public sentiment that the sovereign is inept and some change needs to take place...the flip side is that there is zero confusion in anyone's mind when looking for the people in power that need to be overthrown and killed for this change to occur.\u00a0What the sovereign and the people in power started to realize... is that in this type of society that we're talking about, brutal as it was, the will of the people often had influence over which people were in positions of power...and this could be EXTREMELY inconvenient for the sovereign at times...it made staying in a position of power for any extended period of time a pretty vulnerable enterprise. The people in positions of power knew that something drastic had to change if they wanted to make power more sustainable...and Foucault documents a fundamental shift that occurs in the way societies treat criminals that takes place between the years 1757 and 1837.\u00a0Now, real quick, I'm just anticipating a place that someone's brain might go here: oh, so what you're saying is that a bunch of evil people in positions of power realized that in this older type of society the will of the people ACTUALLY had some influence could throw them OUT of positions of power...so they all got together, met in back rooms, formed a secret society, called it something like the council of the drifting phoenix where they had some creepy secret handshake and they all sat around coming up with ways to control the population so they'd never have to relinquish power. But what Foucault would probably want to point out is that there doesn't need to be some evil secret society for people in government to want power to be more deeply embedded. Remember, the people in positions of power signed a social contract as well. Part of that social contract is maintaining the order of society so that they can continue to guarantee the natural rights of the citizens, and part of maintaining order historically, to Foucault, has been to preserve the existing power structure. There doesn't need to be a single, evil person in any of these positions of power for them to be motivated to come up with new, better tactics to stay in power....and Foucault would say these new tactics that are being implemented between the years 1757 and 1837...is a broader evolution of the way people in power keep prisoners under control.\u00a0These changes occur gradually...over the course of decades...sometimes just with subtle changes to the ceremony of the public execution itself. Whereas before prisoners used to just be paraded around in an open top cart before their execution...slowly over the years that evolved into a closed top cart with wooden planks that you could hardly see the person through...that eventually evolved into a bag being over the person's head and their identity completely concealed. By the 1790's, most societies had moved away from these dramatic or creative public executions and favored the more standardized punishment of a guillotine in front of the courthouse...few years later the guillotine was moved behind the courthouse...until eventually it was moved inside the prison and all the executions were done in private. Punishment...and the reality of the way we treat criminals...has slowly moved from before when it was something that was at the forefront of public consciousness that it was impossible not to be aware of...to now, when it is something abstract, silent, cordoned off and even locked away in these distant far away buildings that we never have to see. To ask a couple more foreshadowing questions: what sort of effects might that have on a society...and more importantly why might people who want to maintain their positions of power prefer a situation like this?\u00a0By the year 1837, two fundamental changes had occurred in the way we punish criminals that Foucault says are extremely deliberate. Number one: putting somebody to death as a public spectacle that everybody gets to witness had all but disappeared. And number two: we had changed tactics from punishing criminals by inflicting harm on their bodies...to the emergence of a new era in our methods of punishing criminals where now we focused primarily on the disciplining and control of their minds. There is a fundamental shift from physical punishment of the person's body...to the disciplining and reformation of the person's mind. This is why Foucault titles the book Discipline and Punish...this is the emergence and infancy of what will eventually become the modern prison...this is the beginning of an evolution where people in positions of power develop a much more efficient and effective way of wielding and sustaining power over people.\u00a0Foucault cites an actual strict schedule that criminals in the 1830's serving time had to follow during their time in prison. You can imagine what something like this might look like: 7am wake up. 7:05 you are to be on your mark for roll call. 7:15 you are to be at the mess hall for breakfast. 7:25 you are to be at your assigned job post for the day. 9:15 water break, 9:20 back to work...in other words: when your ENTIRE day is scheduled and accounted for down to the second...there's not much time for illicit criminal activity. There's not much time for ANY thought outside of disciplining yourself and adhering to this schedule of stuff you're required to do. Well couple this new, strict focus on the disciplining of the mind and reformation of behavior with MORE new tactics that were emerging over the years...more specifically a new, improved, three pronged approach towards controlling prisoners that Foucault thinks is one of the most effective methods that has ever been devised.\u00a0The three...prongs...of this three pronged method that is used to keep prisoners in line...are what Foucault calls: Surveillence, Normalization, and Examination. That is...Constant surveillance of the prisoners...which combines nicely with normalization...or a normalized standard of how a good prisoner should be thinking and behaving that has been given to you by the people in power...and both of these work nicely with a constant process of examination and re-examination where people in positions of power give you a score or a grade determining how well you're corresponding with that way of behaving that we've decided a good prisoner should be a reflection of.\u00a0Foucault thinks this new, highly effective way of controlling prisoners may have sprung out of the work of a philosopher named Jeremy Bentham. The same way Plato in The Republic spends a considerable amount of time trying to come up with the ideal structure of government...Jeremy Bentham spends a bunch of time in HIS work trying to come up with the ideal structure of a prison. The model that he arrives at after thinking about it for so long is what he calls The Panopticon. Simply put, the Panopticon is a building designed and laid out in a clever way, where a single guard, or a warden or anyone in a position of power can stand in a specific spot in the center...and THEY can see inside of the cell of any prisoner they want... but the prisoners can't see them, they can't know WHEN they're being watched, they can't know the criteria that determines WHY they're being watched...in a sense, Bentham says, the reason this is an ideal design for a prison...is because the only reasonable thing the prisoners can do in a prison that's designed this way...is to behave every second of every day as though they're being watched...because they can never know when or when its not happening. Their lives become, once again, constant surveillance through cameras or armed guards, strict adherence to a normalized \"way a good prisoner behaves\" given to them by the people in power, and rigorous examination by experts, or the court system or the parole board or whoever it is THIS WEEK for the prisoner to answer to.\u00a0Now some of you out there might be thinking: why are we going on so much about the history of criminals? What does this have to do with philosophy? What relevance does this have to me whatsoever? Well, if you're someone that's thought that all we've been talking about so far on this episode are methods we've developed over the years for controlling... only prisoners...Foucault would probably say I hope you've been paying attention to the details of what's been said so far...because when Jeremy Bentham sits down and creates the design of this Panopticon of his...hes not just talking about the ideal structure of a prison...and what follows from that is that Foucault is NOT JUST talking about the evolution of methods that we've developed to control prisoners.\u00a0Jeremy Bentham describes the Panopticon very generally in his work\u00a0as \"a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example\"...and knowing that...it makes sense that he quickly goes on to say that although this is the ideal structure of a\u00a0prison if you wanted to control prisoners...there's no reason why this same design couldn't be applied if you wanted to create, you know, a mental institution that promotes a standard to the inmates of what a good patient is...or in a military setting promoting what it is to be a good soldier...or in a university setting promoting how you should think and behave if you want to be a good student...if Bentham lived in a modern economic society he no doubt would see the utility of the Panopticon if it was applied to a factory and producing good factory workers...or even more generally how it could be used at a multi-national corporation trying to produce good employees.\u00a0See, that's the thing. Let's say you're in a position of power in a corporation...to be able to use the fundamentals of these highly effective tactics that have been developed over the years to control your employees, you don't need to treat them like they're a prisoner that's part of a chain gang forced to crush rocks all day...no, as long as you make sure that their chain is long enough that they don't FEEL like a prisoner...you can set up some pretty narrow parameters for what it is to be a \"good employee\" that not only will they fall into...but they will actually police themselves to stay that way...they'll feel intense pressure to adhere to that normalized standard of behavior at all times, because their life at work is one of surveillance, normalization and examination. Surveillance by way of cameras, time clocks, supervisors, deadlines, monitoring activity on your computer, even sometimes just the surveillance of other employees around that feel like they benefit from having dirt on someone in a highly competitive environment. The normalized standard of being a good employee...speaking, acting and dressing in a professional way, however that's defined by whoever in the company. Putting on your work persona...always being politically correct...doing all the things to make sure you're a good team player. Then it's on to the examination phase with your monthly, quarterly, yearly evaluations where they give you a score out of ten in different areas to determine how well your doing...or in other words how well you correspond with exactly who I say you should be. Your productivity is about the same level as last evaluation...you're doing good in some areas...but there's room for improvement in a couple other areas and don't worry...I made an action plan so that we can see if we can get you back on track. This three pronged method... has become the dominant way of controlling human behavior...and if you doubt that in any way...consider the similarities it has to the structure of some religions with the constant surveillance, normative behavior and rigorous process of examination. This method is so effective... and so capable of being applied to any circumstance imaginable...that in our modern world it has so pervaded the way power is exercised that it extends beyond institutions like prisons or corporations and it has embedded itself into the very fabric of society. The very same process of surveillance, normalization and examination could be said to exist in the way you present yourself online...the media you consume...it most likely is even being played out in various social circles that you're a part of right now. Foucault would say one of the truly insidious things about the way power is wielded and people are controlled in modern times with these new methods, is that simultaneously you are both a subject that is being controlled while also being an active participant in the system...an active participant that in some way, most times unknowingly, supports the existing power structure.\u00a0Let's slow down for a second and really talk about what is being implied here for Foucault. Remember the criminal justice system back in the 1750's? So as we talked about the goal of the whole situation back then was clearly not primarily justice or fairness...but instead the benefits the system provided to society when it came to maintaining order and keeping things moving forward. Well Foucault is going to ask: is the penal system of the 1970's really so different when you take a closer look at it? Do we exist in a modern, enlightened era where we've grown throughout history and learned the error of our ways and constructed a penal system that first and foremost has the aim of distributing justice and fairness? To Foucault, the goal of the modern penal system is not justice or fairness...\u0016the goal is through surveillance, normalization and examination to produce harmless, non-rebellious, working, tax-paying productive citizens who follow the rules and are satisfied with a life of conforming to the normalized standard of what it is to be a person handed down to them from above...in other words, docile, useful subjects that carry out the vision for what the future should hold given to them by the people in power.\u00a0This is why there is such a difference when it comes to sentencing between white collar and blue collar crimes. Between an executive that robs the IRS of $20,000 by evading taxes...and some dude that robs a Taco Bell of $85 bucks and a burrito supreme.\u00a0Short of the executive absolutely refusing to pay back the money...9 times out of 10 they are not going to see the inside of a prison cell because their behavior...doesn't really need much reformation in the eyes of the people in power. Keep doing almost everything you're doing...keep working, keep creating jobs, keep starting new companies and going to badminton on Sundays...just pay your taxes. Whereas the guy that robbed the Taco Bell...it doesn't matter if he marches back into the store...hands over the 85 bucks directly to the manager...baby birds the burrito supreme back into his mouth...9 times out of 10 that guy is going to jail because the goal of the penal system is reforming criminals to fit a pre-existing mold of what a normal person is.\u00a0Also consider the fact...that once you're sentenced...it isn't about justice or fairness or some sort of direct punishment and retribution for the crimes you committed at that point either...in today's day and age there's the modern advent of getting out on good behavior. In other words, as long as you're willing to reform yourself into the type of person that we've told you to be...it doesn't really matter what your initial sentence was...we may knock a couple decades off your sentence if you're willing to play by our rules.\u00a0Now\u00a0some people...no matter how many times they go to prison...are just the type of people that are never going to play by the rules. They're never going to become this person the people in power want them to become...they're never going to change... and those people are the people that will either be lifelong repeat offenders in and out of jail...or they will eventually get life in prison.\u00a0And Foucault would say that it's these kinds of people that refuse to play by the rules that are absolutely fascinating to us as \"normal\" people. That's another modern invention for Foucault...thinking of ourselves as normal and the labeling of criminals as \"abnormal\" or people that need to be reformed to a state of normalcy. But its the fact that they're not like normal people that makes us so fascinated by criminals! Look at the thousands of True Crime podcasts that have exploded onto the podcast scene in the past couple years. Massively popular. Look on Netflix at all the crime related shows there are. If you still have a TV subscription, look at all the shows on the air documenting some crime that was committed. This fascination is not a modern phenomena to Foucault...this has existed all throughout our history. In the American West, there was Billy the Kid. In the Great Depression, Bonnie and Clyde. Criminals can even become folk heroes like DB Cooper, but this doesn't just happen in the United States...this has happened all over the world. Part of the reason these older societies moved away from the direction of executing criminals as a public spectacle...is because of the very real effects of what happens when you put a criminal beloved by the public at center stage. Foucault thinks we love criminals so much because when they vehemently refuse to play by the rules of society...they have an ability to show us exactly what we are.\u00a0The law-abiding, occupants and active participants in what is effectively a massive social prison. We live our lives trapped in a cell inside of a Panopticon. Or a Panopticon inside of ANOTHER Panopticon. In fact, the Panopticon is a great metaphor for the entire project of modernity, to Foucault. See just like in the actual prison...where the goal of the operation is not some higher virtue like justice, but instead to reform prisoners into subjects that are useful for keeping society going...we, as occupants of our social prison, are constantly being disciplined and reformed into good employees, good consumers, good voters, good students, good friends..all internalized expectations of ourselves given to us by someone in a position of power. We're given standards by TV shows, movies, books, all media...standards we internalize that tell us how our bodies should look, what beauty is, what you should care about, what you can say and can't say, what some people can do that you can't do, there is no prison or method of torture that has ever been devised that can do to people what they willingly do to themselves in our modern social prison.\u00a0We live in a Panopticon, because we live our lives as though we are constantly being watched and held to these standards about how we should be that are given to us by media. But the truly sick part about it is that we have constructed a world where we are simultaneously... the prisoner being reformed in the cell, AND the warden at the center of the Panopticon that's constantly watching us. We've created a world where we are under constant surveillance by ourselves. Surveillence by looking in the mirror...wondering if you should starve yourself tonight to lose that two pounds that will make you beautiful. Surveillance of your own irrational, toxic thoughts, but you suffer in silence rather than have to face the shame of asking for help and appearing weak to the people around you who NEED you to keep it together. There is no prison that can compare to a life of forcing yourself to adhere to a normalized standard of behavior that tells you the person you should be while constantly being surveyed and examined by yourself and others to make sure you stay that way. This is what Foucault refers to as the geneology of the modern soul.\u00a0Consider the fact that the media you consume even gives you the very vocabulary you have at your disposal, and with it the only categories you have to think about who you even are as a person. THINK ABOUT THAT. Think about the power you could have if you were the person that came up with the only terms people had to\u00a0think about who they even are.\u00a0See all throughout history people have asked the questions: where does power ultimately lie? Who has the power and how is it exercised on people? And there's this classic idea that people have brought up that power lies in the hands of people that are in privileged political positions. The thinking is that if you are the president...you can pass executive orders, you can go across the aisle and find bi-partisan consensus, you can appoint judges that ultimately dictate the law...that is where power lies. But then a Marxist tradition came along and said, no...that's actually a naive understanding of power...because in advanced economic societies...if you can buy the interests of the president...if you can lobby politicians and get legislation influenced in your favor because of financial contributions...then it's not people in privileged political positions that have the power, but people in privileged economic positions. Well, many postmodernists would say, Foucault among them, that the Marxists are just as naive as the people that came before them, and just as hellbent on trying to find some grand narrative to explain everything like they try to do with economics. To Foucault, power doesn't lie in either of these places. See it would be great if power actually did lie in the hands of a relative few like that...to Foucault, it'd be great if something like the illuminati really existed because then, just like in the societies in the 1750's, we could point directly at the people in power and do away with them if things were going bad. But in our modern world, power is much more difficult to identify, and part of the reason is because it has become much more widespread and diffuse. Power, in our modern world to Foucault, is always connected to knowledge. And having recently talked about structuralists and post-structuralists and their views on knowledge claims, we know that knowledge to them is not some objective, codified set of facts about the way the universe is...knowledge to these thinkers is nothing more than the findings of the current, dominant set of cultural discourses and the method that it uses to chop up and make sense of the world.\u00a0So if power lies in the hands of people with knowledge...and knowledge is given to us by people that use narrow, cultural biases to chop up reality...then where do we get our knowledge? And who are these people that arrive at knowledge for us? Well, Science is where we get our knowledge in modern times...and thought leaders within the sciences in their respective fields of study are the people that arrive at knowledge for us to use.\u00a0THIS is where power ultimately lies. You know, Foucault has a famous idea: that man is a recent invention that's reaching its expiration date...that the concept of \"man\" is something that wasn't even talked about until around the 1600's...and part of what he means when he says that is that it wasn't until the 1600's that people really focused on the human sciences as a prescriptive endeavor...it wasn't until the 1600's that fields like psychology, biology, medicine, sociology were being used to try to arrive at a scientific rational idea of \"what it is to be a human being\". Foucault would ask: well who have conducted these experiments that are determining \"what it is to be a human being\"? Have we maybe limited ourselves by only looking at what it is to be a human being from the extremely narrow cultural perspective of almost entirely...men, from a western european cultural background, from a similar educational background, from a similar socio-economic situation where they were able to go to school, get funding for their experiments and were able to think about stuff like this for their entire lives...Foucault would ask: when it comes to our understanding of what it is to be a human being, has the data we've gathered over the years come from such a limited point of view...that much of our understanding of what it is to be a human being is approaching some sort of expiration date?\u00a0"
