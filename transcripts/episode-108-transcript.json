    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #108\u00a0on The Frankfurt School. Check out the episode page HERE.So we\u2019re going to be talking about individual philosophers on most shows, but let\u2019s never forget the fact that our ultimate goal throughout this current arc of the show is to tell some of the MAIN philosophical stories of the twentieth century. And realistically, you could never tell the FULL story on a show like this.But the point is we're talking about more than just individuals now\u2026we\u2019re talking about movements, we\u2019re talking about massive historical events that thinkers are living within and reacting to\u2026we\u2019re telling a STORY, here. And whenever you\u2019re telling a story\u2026sometimes you need a narrator that takes a step back from the individual characters and what they\u2019re saying\u2026 and talks about what\u2019s going on on a larger scale so that you can understand the behavior of the characters better.Why is it\u2026that freedom and responsibility are so important to Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir, specifically in the time they\u2019re living, what were they responding to? Why is Bertrand Russell so concerned with mathematics\u2026why is Wittgenstein SO concerned with language\u2026specifically\u2026during the time he was living in the early 20th century?We have a lot of people to talk about. But one thing I think you\u2019ll find the further we get along this journey\u2026is just how revolutionary of a moment it was in modern human history\u2026 when Nietzsche wrote the words: God is dead. Seriously, if there was a page one of this story that we\u2019re telling\u2026it wouldn\u2019t be once upon a time in that giant Declaration of Independence font\u2026it would be God is dead. He remains dead, and we have killed him.Now when Nietzsche says this\u2026a way someone might misinterpret Nietzsche here is to think oh, he said God is dead\u2026here\u2019s this anti-religious nihilist philosopher triumphantly proclaiming that God is dead calling for us to move onward into a better age where we can get away from the scourge of religion! Not even close to who Nietzsche was or what he was saying\u2026and I think it\u2019s going to be useful for us to talk a little more about what he WAS saying... at least more than we did in Nietzsche pt. 1\u2026real quick, just to get back to where we were in that episode:Think of any universal human problem. Think of a problem where no matter what area of the world your particular ancestors decided to settle\u2026they were going to be faced with this problem and were going to be forced to come up with some creative invention that DEALS with this problem. Carrying a lot of heavy stuff around. No matter where you\u2019re from\u2026your ancestors had to invent something to cope with carrying around heavy stuff. And historically, what we see, are different cultures coming up with slightly different solutions to this problem based on a lot of different factors individual to them\u2026what resources they had, what landmarks were around them, what their lives were like\u2026for example if you were a culture of animal husbandry\u2026some sort of herding culture\u2026maybe you used animals to solve this problem of carrying around heavy stuff. If you were part of a culture that had a lot of trees around you\u2026 maybe you rolled things around on logs\u2026maybe you make a cart or a wagon or a rickshaw, any one of these inventions that ALL are slightly different from each other\u2026 but ultimately were all created by human beings with the same goal in mind: to solve this universal human problem of carrying heavy stuff.Well what\u2019s another universal human problem? What\u2019s a question that every human being asks at some point in their life? What is the meaning of my life? How do I fit into the grand picture of the universe? How can I feel like my life has meaning? In other words, in the same way cultures throughout history have all come up with their own personalized, slightly different, clever inventions that solve the problem of carrying around heavy stuff\u2026Nietzsche would say that all the varying forms of mythology and religion throughout history, have been the same thing: clever human inventions to solve a universal human problem of answering these existential questions.Now fast forward to Nietzsche saying God is Dead. Nietzsche himself is not really doing anything when he just says the words God is Dead\u2026the significance of those words\u2026 lies in him pointing out a reality of the world that\u2019s come to pass.He\u2019s pointing out\u2026 that our understanding of the world has come a long way since the scientific revolution. That science has no doubt given us a lot of incredible things\u2026but we have to start to think about, at what cost has that come? Nietzsche would say that being a human being in this new scientific world we have\u2026is just a totally different situation than any other situation a human has had to face before\u2026that for us\u2026living in a world post-Copernicus, post-Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Freud\u2026living in that world as a human being\u2026it has become next to impossible to simultaneously be both a reasonable person\u2026while also believing that there\u2019s a guy up in the clouds named Zeus with lightning bolts that\u2019s going to zap you if you do something wrong\u2026or that there\u2019s a guy that used to walk on water and cure blind people. In other words, it\u2019s become next to impossible to use one of these clever human inventions\u2026 that solve this universal human problem of searching for meaning.When Nietzsche says God is dead. He\u2019s not saying that in a happy tone, at all. He\u2019s saying it regretfully\u2026FEARFULLY even. Think about the situation we\u2019re in as people: we are TRIBAL creatures. We have such a strong tendency to attach ourselves to some group or some cause\u2026and then the meaning of our life becomes to advance the agenda of OUR group, label some other group as the enemy, and then go to war with that other group. Think of all the OTHER incentives we have to act this way\u2026how good it feels to seemingly have a vice-grip on the way that things are in the world, no further questions, no more cognitive dissonance for me. How good it feels\u2026to derive a sense of identity from these beliefs that you hold\u2026to escape that ambiguity about who you are. Given the reality of human psychology\u2026think of how many barriers are naturally in the way if you want to try to budge somebody OFF of one of these positions\u2026and for tens of thousands of years whenever people have asked what tribe they should be a part of, what their sense of identity should be or where they can get a convenient vice-grip on the truth\u2026for tens of thousands of years mythology and religion has given them those answers.You know, Nietzsche would say that the sort of na\u00efve way of looking at religion is to say, hey\u2026look back at history! Look at all the wars that have been carried out in the name of religion. In the name of these fairy tales people used to believe in\u2026you know what? We need to do away with all this religion nonsense and get rid of this unnecessary bloodshed. Nietzsche would say, ok\u2026let\u2019s do away with religion and start over. Do you think the history of the world is going to be a bunch of science fairs and meditation seminars? No\u2026it would still be a violent and bloody clash\u2026 of people organizing into groups, thinking in terms of us vs. them, exercising their will to power\u2026it just wouldn\u2019t be religious groups carrying it out. In fact there\u2019s people that make the case that religion may have been a moderating influence on the violence throughout history\u2026because at least it allowed people to organize into these MASSIVE groups of millions people\u2026as opposed to the world being much more fragmented and volatile.When Nietzsche says God is dead he\u2019s not talking about the literal death of some deity. He\u2019s talking about the death of humanity\u2019s pursuit for moral objectivity. He\u2019s talking about the death\u2026of people having a ready-made answer that fills that void within them that craves meaning. Nietzsche\u2019s asking: what are people going to do now that they don\u2019t have that answer? Remember, to Nietzsche, 95% of people are the mob\u2026they\u2019re camels, beasts of burden, all of their beliefs and values loaded onto their backs by other people\u2026they\u2019re scared and lazy and generally speaking are just not the kind of people that are going to read up on some existentialism and fill this void in other ways. And it\u2019s not like when you cut the legs out from underneath religion science just naturally fills that void\u2026.people aren\u2019t sitting around saying, well there\u2019s no meaning to anything I do\u2026but I got a large Hadron collider for Christmas\u2026that\u2019ll be fun. Just got a new iPhone\u2026spiritual guidance\u2026I think I\u2019m good for a while! No that void doesn\u2019t just magically disappear\u2026and they\u2019re GOING to fill it with something\u2026the question becomes: now that it\u2019s a near impossibility to fill it with religion\u2026 what are people going to fill it with?Nietzsche predicts in his book The Will to Power...very ominously\u2026that in the next 100 years after writing that book\u2026tens of millions of people are going to die because of the position we\u2019ve worked ourselves into. Nietzsche saw the beginning of the twentieth century before it even happened. In many ways, he saw the world we still live in today before it even happened. Out went religion and in came ideology. Nationalism\u2026Marxism\u2026Capitalism\u2026tons of other isms you could throw in there. The story of the 20th century is in large part a story of competing ideologies living in the wake of the death of God.When the French Existentialists\u2026Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Camus\u2026are writing their work\u2026part of the reason why they\u2019re so focused on making a case for individuality\u2026 is because they\u2019re living in the middle of Nazi occupied France. They\u2019re living in a world where people are thinking of themselves first, and primarily as a member of some group\u2026 and THEN as an individual human being.I am a German. Germany is one of the great nations of the world. If we\u2019re ever going to assume our rightful place as a world power we\u2019re going to have to take back some of the land THEY took from US through the treaty of Versailles. Us vs. Them. People identifying themselves in terms of their GROUP identity rather than their individuality. The reason freedom and responsibility is so important to the French Existentialists\u2026is because people were using this group identity, as a justification for doing horrible things\u2026 and then pretending they had no choice in the matter because this is what their group is doing.For example, look\u2026I\u2019m a just Nazi Soldier\u2026if one of the higher ups orders me to go round up those kids over there and put a bullet in their head\u2026I\u2019m just a soldier following orders. I had no choice in the matter. Or on the other side\u2026hey, I\u2019m just a citizen of France I didn\u2019t want to go to war. Those Nazi people have guns\u2026what can I do but just sit around weave flowers together so I can throw them on whoever comes and saves me? I don\u2019t have a choice in the matter.The existentialists are responding to this thinking by saying, no\u2026in both cases, you didn\u2019t need to kill those kids and you could\u2019ve been actively part of the resistance\u2026in other words: you DID have a choice, and you are responsible for what you have done. The consequences for making that different choice may have been dire for you, but one thing the existentialists aren\u2019t going to allow\u2026 is to let you get away with pretending to be some droning, mindless member of a group that\u2019s devoid of individual autonomy. But, on the other hand\u2026again, an integral part of being a human being is FEELING like you\u2019re a member of some group that is fighting for good. That\u2019s the sort of ambiguity that we have to navigate as people in this new post-scientific revolution world. And if you\u2019re not an EXTREMELY self-aware and HONEST person\u2026as Simone De Beauvoir warns about\u2026you can very easily find yourself a foot soldier for some tyrannical group\u2026all the while feeling TOTALLY morally justified\u2026feeling like you\u2019re a good person while doing it. As people that are alive today\u2026JUST like the people of Germany in the 1930\u2019s\u2026we all carry this burden of potentially reducing ourselves to just a foot soldier of an ideological group, but we CAN\u2019T forget our individuality.Now one of the main ideologies that people attached themselves to and worked to advance throughout the 20th century\u2026 was neo-Marxism and its varying forms. In fact, at the same time Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir and Camus are doing their work in France\u2026there\u2019s a group of Marxists that had been working on their own projects since the 1920\u2019s that would come to be known as The Frankfurt School. Now this needs a bit of a setup\u2026to understand where the mindset of a western Marxist was during this time period\u2026 we have to talk about a couple prophesies that were made by Marx himself back in his time.Remember Hegel\u2019s Dialectic? The idea is that the process of change throughout history can be understood in terms of a repetition of three stages that Hegel calls the Thesis, the Antithesis and the Synthesis. There\u2019s a way that things are\u2026that\u2019s the Thesis\u2026some competing interest comes along and overthrows that way of doing things, but inevitably the pendulum swings too far in that other direction and eventually finds a resting point somewhere in the middle of the Thesis and Antithesis in a place Hegel calls the Synthesis. The Synthesis then becomes the new Thesis and so on and so forth throughout the history of time. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the concept and want more of an explanation, you can always go back and listen to the Hegel episodes.Well, as Marx famously writes, \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\u201d In other words, during his time Marx looks back at the history of the world and points out that when people go to war, or there\u2019s some sort of bloody revolution or civil war, people primarily tend to go to war for economic reasons. The history of the world to Marx seems to be, in a way that resembles Hegel\u2019s dialectic, a revolving door of a ruling class exerting control over an exploited class of people (the thesis), the exploited class of people rising up and overthrowing that ruling class (the antithesis), and then a new ruling class being elected that appears to be slightly better for the formerly exploited class (the synthesis). That new ruling class becomes the new thesis\u2026 and the whole process repeats itself over and over again. Marx points out how in every single economic system that\u2019s ever been implemented throughout history\u2026you always have this dynamic\u2026there always seems to be a ruling class and an exploited class. During the Feudal System there was the peasantry and the Aristocracy. In a slave based economy there are the slaves and the slave owners. To Karl Marx, capitalism is the same way. There are the people that control the resources and the means of production, and then there\u2019s the working class.During his time, Marx asks a question that would go on to change the course of human history. Why does it have to be this way? Does it? Do you think\u2026even potentially\u2026that there might be some sort of economic system we could put in place that doesn\u2019t have to involve this dialectic of class struggles? How many people need to die before we start to try to come up with some way that people don\u2019t need to be exploited\u2026 and there doesn\u2019t need to be this inevitable process of revolution and bloodshed?Well, after realizing this\u2026there\u2019s good news and bad news says Marx at this point. The bad news is people are currently being exploited\u2026right now\u2026but the good news is: we know exactly where this is going, because it\u2019s happened all throughout history. Here\u2019s the prophecy he makes: There\u2019s an industrial revolution going on in Europe at the time he\u2019s alive\u2026 and it\u2019s in these high production areas that the ruling vs exploited class dynamic of capitalism is going to be the most pronounced. Just like the peasants immiserated under the Feudal system, the working class in this capitalist system is eventually going to rise up, take over the means of production\u2026 and it\u2019s at that point that we should implement a system that DOESN\u2019T have this exploitation built into it.Well fast forward to Germany in the 1920\u2019s in what\u2019s known as the \u201cinterwar period\u201d, or the years in between the end of WW1 and the beginning of WW2. At this point in time there\u2019s a lot of Marxist thinkers sitting around waiting for this revolution to come about\u2026but strangely\u2026it hasn\u2019t happened yet. In fact, it seems like its not coming. There\u2019s an attempt immediately following the end of WW1 and all the turmoil that came with that\u2026but the Weimar Republic ends up winning and assuming control of Germany and a lot of thinkers were starting to doubt whether Marx was right with this whole grand prophecy of his.Not only that, they took look at the only country that\u2019s HAD a communist revolution at the time\u2026NOT an industrial society like Marx predicted but a predominantly AGRICULTURAL society at the time in Russia\u2026they see Marxism become this Leninist Authoritarianism that\u2019s going on there in the 1920\u2019s\u2026and what happens is this general attitude of skepticism towards Marx and his original theories\u2026 starts to creep in. Was Marx correct? Has this just been a massive failed experiment based on a misunderstanding of history?Now it should be said: there are people that just ignore everything that\u2019s going on and trudge forward with Marxism version 1.0\u2026there\u2019s other people that abandon Marxism thinking that it\u2019s failed. But there\u2019s a strong contingency of thinkers in the middle, The Frankfurt School among others\u2026thinkers in the middle that are still Marxists\u2026they still strongly believe in the world that Marxism is trying to bring about, but they\u2019re highly critical of Marx for a few different reasons. Many critiques but two of the major ones are that Marx doesn\u2019t talk enough about the concept of personal liberty within his system and he doesn\u2019t do enough to consider the individual. Remember, the thinkers of the Frankfurt School are living right around the same time as Husserl and Heidegger and Sartre\u2026 and all these other thinkers that, like we talked about, are highly skeptical of enlightenment style thinking\u2026of exalting reason onto this pedestal above everything else and trying to reduce everything, including human beings within a society down into these convenient, rational categories. During the time Karl Marx wrote his work, the concept of the individual just wasn\u2019t being considered in the same way it was during the time of the Frankfurt School, and the thinkers OF the Frankfurt School saw that as a huge blind spot within Marxism.Just to keep this organized: The Frankfurt School was a collection of neo-Marxists\u2026convinced that Marxism was still correct overall\u2026but that it needed some serious reworking\u2026especially if it was ever going to work where they eventually wanted to implement it\u2026 in western countries including but not limited to: the United States.Now, researchers in the Soviet Union compiled a collection of Marx\u2019s notes that was never before published called: economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844. Now, not only did this book provide a never before seen more Hegelian interpretation of Marx\u2026but this book was published in 1932\u2026perfect timing if you're someone who is a western Marxist and you want a fresh perspective on the whole situation. Couple this with the fact that basically every thinker in the first generation of the Frankfurt School was of Jewish descent\u2026living in Germany during the interwar years\u2026seeing the rising tide of anti-Semitism and Nazism all around them\u2026they saw the writing on the wall: first they moved the school out of Frankfurt to Geneva and then ultimately to New York City for several years where they embedded themselves into Columbia University.So what were the goals of the Frankfurt School? Well, their short term goals were to take a deep look at enlightenment style thinking and try to figure out how it was possible\u2026for the world to go from a place technologically and culturally more advanced than it had ever been in history\u2026only to instantly devolve into the most barbaric, brutal, hateful event in human history\u2026 in WW2. The Frankfurt school wanted to understand\u2026how was that even possible? What it is about this post enlightenment world that makes that possible? The conclusions they arrive at range from interesting to downright scary. We\u2019ll talk about them in the upcoming episodes of the show.Later works of the Frankfurt School focus on a critique of Capitalism. Which naturally extends to a critique of the people they think are being exploited, Frankfurt School pointing at the invisible chains they say people unknowingly wear around each day and how they manifest into their lives. Which naturally extends to a critique of various traditions and institutions within those cultures.Now, some of these critiques are scathing to the point that they take things that are long standing institutions within western culture and they shine a light on them that makes people never see them in the same way again...and when it comes to these critiques\u2026how people say you should interpret them and what the ultimate goals of the Frankfurt School were, is all over the map. Some people think this is just naturally what happens when Marxist thought clashes with Capitalist thought. That Capitalism, is an antiquated system\u2026founded on traditions that by their very nature are oppressive, don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny and that certain western traditions involving the church, lack of community, views on family among other things\u2026those traditions are what was necessary for the ruling vs exploited class dynamic to ever get off the ground in the first place. These people say this scathing critique is just Marxism holding a candle to weak traditions.There are other people more in the middle that think both Marxism and Capitalism are viable systems if implemented correctly. That the critiques of the Frankfurt School, if they did anything, point out certain weak points that we, as a Capitalist society, should keep in mind moving forward when refining our systems and continuing to make things better.There are other people that believe that the Frankfurt School is a group of Neo-Marxist thinkers engaged in a direct attack, the goal being to subvert western values, weaken the foundations of every aspect of western culture, then watch as the foundation eventually crumbles making it much easier to bring about a Marxist revolution in the west.Point is: this conversation about how to interpret the critiques of the Frankfurt School can go on for days, and I\u2019m not interested in being the one that makes the final proclamation. So I\u2019ll leave you to make your own determination about what was going on inside the heads of the people that talk about these ideas, all I\u2019m interested in is the merit of the ideas and what\u2019s interesting about them.Which brings me to a point I want to make. Just some things I want to put out there because I feel like they need to be said. I fully realize how political the world has become in the last year. I fully realize that there are podcasts and shows out there that used to do great content that now have become first and foremost a soapbox for some political ideology and secondarily content for their listeners. I just want to iterate that even though subject matters in the near future may trespass into places that are still relevant to modern politics\u2026this is not the show becoming some bullhorn for who the next president should be\u2026not that I even have strong enough political views to warrant doing a show on them\u2026and maybe that makes me the perfect person to do this series.Look, I come from poverty. I absolutely CHERISH being able to do this podcast for a living. The idea that I would dilute the show down and waste your time like that\u2026I mean if you knew me personally you\u2019d know that that\u2019s the furthest thing from who I am. I approach every episode of this show with the same question: how can I give the people listening to me the most value possible\u2026 in these 30 minutes of their time they\u2019ve given me? To me, it\u2019s an unselfish way of approaching the show that I think is a big reason why I\u2019ve been able to do this as long as I have. I respect your time\u2026and I guess I just want to plant a flag in the ground here and make a couple promises moving forward.I promise to cover these issues as fairly as I can. And I\u2019m not just talking about the typical binary left/right way of looking at things\u2026I plan on covering these subjects from multiple different angles that are interesting\u2026if I can\u2019t be comprehensive, I just won\u2019t cover it.Secondly, my hunch is that the majority of you listening, even if you\u2019re a hardcore capitalist or Marxist, my hunch is that you\u2019d welcome and be excited to hear a deep reading of the philosophy that underlies the other side respectively. They may ask questions you don\u2019t have answers to that you can look into\u2026at the very least you come out having strengthened your views from seeing the best the other side has to offer. But even if you\u2019re not that open minded and you\u2019ve already joined the tribe\u2026even if in this world where God is Dead you\u2019ve labeled one of those groups your mortal enemy that you have to fight against for the rest of your life\u2026I promise I\u2019m going to do these episodes in a way where you\u2019re still going to get something out of it.Now onto the question some of you are probably wondering: where\u2019s Camus? You said on Facebook Camus would be here, where is he?! Camus\u2019 coming, he\u2019s stuck in traffic he\u2019s going to be here soon. No, here\u2019s the thing about Camus. Throughout the next several episodes, we\u2019re not just going to be talking about Marxism and Capitalism from the perspective of the Frankfurt School\u2026we\u2019re going to be looking at it through the lens of thinkers that are critical of Marxism\u2026of which\u2026Camus is one of them and he\u2019s a particularly interesting one because he\u2019s a French Existentialist who\u2019s NOT a Marxist, unlike Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir\u2026AND he has a really interesting take on how Marxism starts to look like a direct mirror of Christianity\u2026you know with the dialectic as this absolute governing force moving us providentially into a particular direction\u2026the idea of this dialectic moving us toward some sort of ultimate end\u2026there being notable figures throughout its history that resemble saints and bishops\u2026heresy trials\u2026there are many parallels that we\u2019ll talk about more in depth when we get there.Anyway, to bring this full circle there are a couple ideas from Camus I want to expand on that I didn\u2019t get to finish in the last Camus episode because I was pressed for time. Nietzsche talks about this void that we have inside of us that craves meaning\u2026this void that\u2019s such a default, universal part of what it is to be a human being that some people aren\u2019t even aware that they have it\u2026they just fill it up with something immediately around them and then assume their role as a tribal zealot for the rest of their life. But what I love about Camus in the Myth of Sisyphus is that he talks about the process of discovering that void for the first time. When exactly do we realize there\u2019s something lacking in that department?Remember, Sisyphus is a man condemned by the Gods to an eternity of pushing a boulder up a hill, only to reach the top and watch as the boulder rolls back down to the bottom of the hill, at which point he walks back down to the bottom of the hill to start the process over again\u2026THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE\u2026of struggling and straining and feeling pain and exerting yourself only to have all of your efforts ultimately be for nothing. This is a metaphor\u2026for life, to Camus. We live in a universe that is so inconceivably large and complex and of a scope that we as humans can\u2019t even wrap our heads around. We live our lives\u2026with every step we take we fight against a tidal wave of things trying to kill us all the time\u2026we coast through good times struggle through bad ones\u2026only to reach the end of our lives to have to accept our fate that the universe really doesn\u2019t care about anything that you did. Certainly in a humanistic sense what you do matters\u2026it matters to the microscopic scaffolding that we\u2019ve set up on this dust speck out in the boonies of an ordinary galaxy, but on the level of the universe? Sun\u2019s going to blow up in 5 billion years, where\u2019s this podcast going to be then? Where\u2019s your stamp collection going to be that you\u2019ve worked so hard to complete?We\u2019re all a little like Sisyphus in that regard\u2026we\u2019re all rolling these boulders up our respective hills only to have it ultimately be for nothing\u2026and at the end of the last episode on Camus I made the point that maybe we ARE all like Sisyphus in a way, but that Camus says we\u2019re only condemned by the Gods to push the boulder, not to agonize over the process\u2026and that we should strive to enjoy the process of pushing the boulder as much as we can\u2026that we should imagine Sisyphus smiling. I said all that, but I never really got to go into how Camus thinks you should be going about doing that.Camus gives two main strategies that Sisyphus uses to remain happy\u2026you know, even though\u2026 he\u2019s condemned for all eternity to push a boulder up a hill. Camus would say that as outsiders\u2026if we could sit on the sidelines and somehow watch Sisyphus push the boulder up the hill over and over again\u2026 it would no doubt look to us like a totally meaningless, tortuous, insane thing that Sisyphus is being forced to do. But at what point does Sisyphus realize that it\u2019s all meaningless? It\u2019s only when Sisyphus STOPS being present\u2026takes a step back and says: wait a second\u2026why am I pushing this boulder anyway? Looks around him\u2026can\u2019t make sense of it and deems it all to be meaningless, it\u2019s only at that point that this concept of meaning comes into play at all.10 seconds ago he was just pushing a boulder. It wasn\u2019t until he stopped and reflected on the fact that he was pushing the boulder\u2026 that he started feeling like something was lacking. This is an example of a recurring theme that comes up in every single one of Camus\u2019 books. It\u2019s the contrast between reflection and lived experience. Camus would say think about what you\u2019re doing whenever you stop to reflect on something. You stop doing whatever it is you\u2019re doing\u2026 and you use your capacity to reason to try to make sense of things by asking a bunch of questions. Why am I pushing this boulder up the hill? Why am I here? Why do my actions matter?Well consider for a second just how presumptuous and arrogant that whole reasoning process is. I\u2019m going to take this narrow, human, rational scope that I have called reason\u2026a scope that is limited and biased and existing really only because its sufficient at allowing my ancestors to pick mangos and reproduce\u2026and I\u2019m going to use this tool and impose this rationality onto the UNIVERSE\u2026and see what conclusions I arrive at when it comes to what the whole purpose of it is. Right. What if reason is not the right tool for the job? What if you had some rusty hammer held together by string and some old Allen wrench from IKEA and someone told you to put together a space shuttle. You\u2019d say, are you serious? I mean, I can try\u2026I guess. The same way an Allen wrench is not the right tool for putting together a space shuttle, reflection and the human capacity to reason is not the right tool for understanding things like the meaning or non-meaning of the things that you do.Again, keep in mind that this critique of reason is very popular among the thinkers of this era\u2026 and it\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re going to talk about with the Frankfurt School. But anyway, the way Sisyphus deals with this absurdity of the universe\u2026the way he deals with the fact that bad sometimes triumphs over good and that my grandma died and I didn\u2019t want her to and that my car broke down and that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real, the way that he deals with all this stuff\u2026Camus says Sisyphus makes his rock his thing.What he means is Sisyphus is happy\u2026because he chooses to fully engage himself in his work. So if reflecting on what the ultimate meaning of pushing the boulder is is never going to leave us with a satisfactory answer\u2026why not focus ALL of your effort on being engaged in the task you\u2019re currently doing? See to Camus\u2026reflection is good\u2026it certainly is a necessary part of life\u2026but there\u2019s a point of diminishing returns. You can reflect too much\u2026and all it\u2019s going to do at that point is deteriorate the quality of your lived experience.No, accept the absurdity of the universe\u2026and then immerse yourself back into being more fully engaged in the tasks you care about. What Sisyphus does\u2026is he learns to love his rock that he pushes up the hill. He studies all the little grooves in the rock\u2026all the different ways the grooves interact with the soil underneath. He pays attention to his posture and form when guiding the rock. He studies patterns in the ways the rock rolls back down the hill. He tries to find the most efficient way of getting back down the hill to start over. He makes the rock his thing.Camus says that one strategy WE can use\u2026 is to be as engaged in the tasks of our lives\u2026 as Sisyphus is with his rock. Maybe for you that\u2019s appreciating your family more deeply. Maybe it\u2019s eating great food\u2026maybe it\u2019s working on contemplative stuff to get your mental game on another level. Point is: sometimes\u2026if we spend too much time reflecting, looking at things from the outside all the time\u2026we can lose sight of the significance and the beauty of these moments because we\u2019re just not as engaged as we could be.Kierkegaard has an example he uses where he talks about a couple out in public showing some strong levels of affection for each other. They\u2019re making out\u2026rubbing all over each other\u2026breathing heavy\u2026gross. And he says that if you just look at what they\u2019re doing from the sidelines and reflect on it\u2026if you REALLY look at what it is they\u2019re doing\u2026it\u2019s the most ridiculous thing you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. I want to put my lips up against your lips and feel a tickly feeling as I move them around and I want to hold you in one place and rub my hands all over your clothes to feel what kind of cotton/polyester blend you\u2019re wearing today. It\u2019s completely ridiculous.The whole process can seem that way when you\u2019re reflecting on it\u2026no it\u2019s only when\u2026you\u2019re the one doing the kissing, that you understand it. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re fully engaged in the act itself that any of the significance and the meaning starts to make sense to you. So too with the things we do in life.I\u2019ll leave the second strategy Sisyphus uses for our response to the Frankfurt School.Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time."
