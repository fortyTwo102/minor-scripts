Imagine you went out to dinner with your friends or family. Imagine you had a good time\u2026it was a good meal\u2026the staff of the restaurant only sung happy happy birthday to seven people around you on this particular occasion. And as you exiting the restaurant and you\u2019re heading out to your car you hear a sound and you look over to your right and you\u2019re shocked to see a little girl\u2026maybe four\u2026five years old\u2026lying in the gutter\u2026crying\u2026bleeding out of her head\u2026looks terrified\u2026you look around nobodies helping\u2026she doesn\u2019t seem to have any parents around.\u00a0\u00a0What would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop and help the girl? Or would you look at her\u2026continue walking to your car and just go on about your day? I think somewhere around 99% of people would say that they would stop and help the girl.\u00a0\u00a0Now\u2026new situation\u2026imagine instead you were watching this on the news\u2026there\u2019s a story about a four year old girl that died in front of a restaurant and they were showing security footage of 10\u202620 people coming out of the restaurant\u2026looking at this little girl lying in the gutter who could be dying\u2026and they just kinda shrug say oh well and keep going to their car.\u00a0\u00a0What would you think of those people? Well again, I think most of us would say\u2026how could they possibly do that? More than that\u2026how could you possibly live with yourself for the rest of your life knowing that you COULD have saved this little girl\u2019s life\u2026you COULD have done something about it\u2026but instead you decided to just turn a blind eye and go on about your day? What was so important that a human life couldn\u2019t be saved?\u00a0Peter Singer points out: we currently live in a world where 6.9 million children die a year of completely preventable, poverty related causes. That boils down to about 19,000 children every single day. We currently live in a world where each and every one of the people that were negatively judging those other people walking past the little girl dying on the news\u2026have resources AND access to charities that could decrease that number\u2026yet they choose not to. Now given that we\u2019ve already established that we care about the cause of children dying when we could have done something about it, why are we so willing to help the girl in front of the restaurant and simultaneously so willing to turn a blind eye to the millions dying a year when we could do something about it?\u00a0Maybe the best place to start\u2026maybe the place Peter Singer would start\u2026is to congratulate you. Peter Singer would like to personally congratulate you on winning the lottery. You know its funny whenever you see people in the United States lining up down the block\u2026waiting to get their powerball ticket because its up to 1.7 trillion dollars or whatever it is\u2026its surpassed the national debt and these people are trying to see if their piece of paper will win! But just think about what they\u2019re doing\u2026they\u2019re essentially asking the universe to let them win the lottery twice in one lifetime\u2026because I got news for you\u2026for reasons we\u2019ve talked about all throughout the history of this show\u2026if you\u2019re born into modern western civilization\u2026in relation to every other human being that has walked the face of the planet\u2026you have already won the lottery. The efficiency your money commands\u2026the amount of money you get paid for the job that you do\u2026the benefits you have\u2026the access to fresh food, water, entertainment, healthcare\u2026of course every ONE of these things could be better, but from a historical context you are the sultan of bernai.\u00a0\u00a0Ah yes\u2026modern civilization is pretty great. It\u2019s become almost an inexorable fact of life that you go to work\u2026you make money\u2026you bring it home and then you use it buy things that you don\u2019t necessarily need. Just think of how AMAZING that is! Think of the scarcity that\u2019s haunted practically every generation of human being that has ever lived\u2026We\u2019re not tribespeople anymore\u2026we\u2019re not peasants trying to scrape by enough to barely feed ourselves with\u2026every single person listening to this right now buys stuff\u2026they do no need. Let me tell you\u2026as someone that was homeless at the age of nine\u2026living off of bread for three months of my life before child protective services came and got me\u2026you COULD be spending less than you do. And that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person! That\u2019s the point! Peter Singer thinks this is actually a really exciting thing!\u00a0Think of the opportunity that you have\u2026 that no other human in the history of the world has ever had! You have the resources at your disposal to save lives! Maybe a key point to mention is that we should all understand\u2026that there is a direct relationship between the resources you have at your disposal and your moral culpability in situations you find yourself in.\u00a0\u00a0For example\u2026imagine there\u2019s a person drowning in a lake. Now let\u2019s say you\u2019re wearing clothes\u2026not that strange of a situation to imagine\u2026you COULD take off your shirt\u2026hold the shirt out to the person in the water and pull them to safety.\u00a0 OR you could stand there and watch them drown\u2026because that\u2019s your favorite shirt. You just saw them over there eating Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos\u2026you\u2019re not gonna let them get their greasy red fingers all over your favorite shirt! They don\u2019t even make this shirt anymore!\u00a0Now a lot of people there would say that you were wrong for not sacrificing your shirt to save a human life\u2026now imagine you\u2019re in the exact same situation except now you\u2019re a member of some nudist brigade\u2026nobodies gonna say you did anything wrong\u2026you didn\u2019t have a T-shirt that you could sacrifice in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0This is an example of how the resources at our disposal sometimes change whether we\u2019re seen as morally reprehensible. Now you might be thinking this isn\u2019t fair\u2026I didn\u2019t actually DO anything.\u00a0 Sure, I didn\u2019t donate\u2026but it\u2019s not like I karate chopped one of these starving kids in the neck\u2026in fact I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026how can you say I\u2019m a bad person when I really haven\u2019t done\u2026anything\u2026on either side of the issue.\u00a0\u00a0Well in the words of Peter Singer, being a good person or leading an ethical life\u2026is not only about staying away from the \u201cthou shalt nots\u201d\u2026sometimes there are things that we are morally obligated to act on\u2026the \u201cthou\u2026shalts\u201d I guess. And there is a direct relationship between the resources at your disposal and how many of these thou shalts we have to consider during our time on this planet\u2026and this really shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise\u2026I mean, on episode 59 of this show called Categorical Trolley Cars we talk about the famous ethical dilemma where a train is barreling down the tracks towards five people\u2026all of them are going to die\u2026the only way to save them is to pull a lever that would switch the train onto a different track where only one person is going to die. The question is: do you pull the lever to save the five over the one.\u00a0\u00a0Well think of the lever in that ethical dilemma as resources at your disposal. Fact is, if you didn\u2019t HAVE a lever that could switch the train onto a different track\u2026you wouldn\u2019t be at a moral decision point..you\u2019d just be some weird person that hangs around train tracks and likes to watch people die.\u00a0The fact that you have the resource of the lever\u2026changes everything. It gives you more potential choices to pick from on the multiple choice choose your own ending book of living an ethical life. Peter Singer would say that inaction does not absolve you of all guilt. No, by choosing NOT to pull the lever\u2026by choosing NOT to use resources at your disposal\u2026you\u2019re still making a choice. And you\u2019d have to ask yourself\u2026as someone who\u2019s already established themselves as a person who cares about the child dying in front of the restaurant\u2026someone who cares to the extent that they feel it would be wrong NOT to intervene\u2026someone who certainly wouldn\u2019t give someone a free pass if they said what? I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026I just walked past the kid to my car! You\u2019d have to ask yourself\u2026why aren\u2019t we giving more to these causes? Is it just because they\u2019re far away from us and we don\u2019t have to look the suffering in the eyes ourselves?\u00a0Peter Singer talks about a sprightly young chap named Toby Ord. Toby Ord was a graduate student in philosophy at Oxford when he asked himself this question. He calculated how much money he needed to live comfortably\u2026about 18000 pounds a year..and subtracted that from the total amount of money he was going to make over the course of his career\u2026and what he realized was that on top of living a totally comfortable lifestyle..he could also give enough back to cure roughly 80,000 people of blindness in countries rife with poverty. There\u2019s a bacterial infection called trachoma\u2026gets under your eyelids\u2026pus starts oozing out\u2026gross\u2026point is\u2026it\u2019s completely treatable\u2026costs about 40 bucks to do, but if you don\u2019t treat it fast enough\u2026you go blind. Blind for the rest of your life because you didn\u2019t have 40 dollars. Estimates are that around 6 million people have gone blind from trachoma\u2026and this is the cause Toby Ord wanted to do the most he could to help.\u00a0\u00a0Now Peter Singer would say\u2026sure it\u2019s great that Toby Ord wanted to give so much, but we don\u2019t all have to give MASSIVE portions of our income to be able to make a difference\u2026we don\u2019t all have to be Toby Ords. In Peter Singer\u2019s book: The Most Good You Can Do\u2026he advocates 10%. Most churches ask you to donate 10% of your income\u2026for most people it\u2019s not a life ending amount of money to give\u2026but it IS a life SAVING amount of money to give. Plus think of where that money is going\u2026if you give it to your church\u2026what are they gonna do with it\u2026fix up the rec room? Maybe print up more of those glossy colorful pamphlets they like to leave on everyone\u2019s front door step? No question they\u2019re using it for the most good they can, but that money would accomplish SO MUCH MORE in Africa than it ever could in the United States. What he\u2019s saying is\u2026It\u2019s not enough just to give to charity\u2026we have to be smart about it\u2026we have to use our capacity to reason to find not just where our resources will help, but where our resources will do the most good they possibly can.\u00a0\u00a0This is the \u201ceffective\u201d part of effective altruism\u2026and it\u2019s extremely important. We all have known somebody that meant well and they really wanted to try to help someone\u2026but the stuff they did to try to help ended up doing more harm than good\u2026we can all imagine someone who has great intentions\u2026tons of heart\u2026they feel so strongly for a cause\u2026but if they don\u2019t think through what they\u2019re going to do\u2026they\u2019re just this big bundle of emotions with zero direction. If you feel like donating money to try to make the world a better place\u2026instead of donating it to your alma mater\u2026or to the church down the street so they can buy more lemon cookies for fellowship\u2026Peter Singer\u2019s saying use that ability to reason to find where the money is going to do the most good it can.\u00a0\u00a0Something interesting that struck me as I was reading this is that this commitment to use that capacity to reason to find how you can effectively do the most good possible for a cause that you care about\u2026it extends beyond just the resource of money and the cause of eliminating poverty. Like, I realize I\u2019m not\u2026you know\u2026curing the blind in Africa\u2026but as you guys know I think philosophical thinking is a very important thing to spread around in the world\u2026i think there\u2019s nothing that affects everything quite like philosophy\u2026it\u2019s a cause I care about a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Now I\u2019m not getting rich doing this show, I love doing it\u2026and about a year into doing the show I had a pretty strong influx of people that were telling me\u2026people I respected\u2026that I obviously like to explain things\u2026why don\u2019t I go back and get my teaching certification\u2026would take two years\u2026and quit the show and go be a teacher somewhere\u2026maybe I could work my way up to that prestigious job at a community college I\u2019ve always wanted! Their point was\u2026I\u2019d be making a lot more money teaching at a college\u2026not to mention the wonders it would do on my self esteem to be able to have people groveling at my feet for a grade. I could walk around with a sense of entitlement on campus\u2026it\u2019d be great!\u00a0And I gotta be honest I thought about it a lot\u2026but then I thought of something and I haven\u2019t thought about it since. Yeah, professors make a lot more money\u2026but they also charge their students tuition, which is extremely limiting. This podcast is free. How many people am I going to be spreading this message to as a teacher? 200 students in a class\u20265 classes? What 1000 people a semester? 1000 people download this show in an hour. Point is\u2026much like Peter Singer talking about reasoning to the way of contributing to a cause that you care about that\u2019s going to do the most good\u2026this show is a much more effective way of getting this message that I care about so much out to as many people as possible. I guess I just want to make the point that whatever cause you care about, personally, is there a way you might be able to sacrifice a little bit of personal comfort in the name of doing the most good you can do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ok so we\u2019ve established that we care about the dying little girl\u2026we\u2019ve established we WOULD intervene and morally condemn others who did NOT choose to intervene\u2026we\u2019ve established that we DO in fact have at least a dollar that we COULD give and that inaction is not a get out of jail free card. We\u2019ve established all that and yet\u2026I\u2019m gonna guess\u2026there probably are tons of people out there still listening to this that really want to disagree with Peter Singer. A lot of people feel attacked\u2026and it\u2019s easy to understand where they\u2019re coming from.\u00a0I\u2019m not a bad person\u2026I volunteer down at the food bank\u2026this old lady dropped her change purse the other day\u2026I picked it up and gave it back to her\u2026I don\u2019t FEEL like a bad person\u2026yet here I am Peter Singer being told by you that I\u2019m doing something wrong! This sort of dynamic is a perfect recipe if you want to get people to come up with arguments for why they act the way they do that aren\u2019t necessarily philosophically sound\u2026but are attempts at trying to justify the way they already behave. You see this same sort of behavior when you talk to people about why they treat their significant other the way they do like in our insecurity episode\u2026when you talk to people about the reasons they give for why killing animals for food is morally justifiable\u2026and unsurprisingly another area that Peter Singer specializes in: the life of an effective altruist in today\u2019s extremely unique world. Now because of this dynamic\u2026he spends most of the works that he\u2019s done on this subject answering common questions and counterarguments that people commonly throw his way whenever he has conversations about it. So let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common ones\u2026\u00a0One argument that always seems to come up is\u2026alright Peter Singer\u2026you care about the children? Do you REALLY care about the children? Well I think if you honestly cared about them\u2026you wouldn\u2019t spend your time writing books about how everyone else should be helping them\u2026you\u2019d quit your job as a philosopher and go down there yourself and provide aid to these people. And on that same note\u2026where do we draw the line? Let\u2019s say I really feel compelled now to help end global poverty\u2026can there be too much of a good thing? Why shouldn\u2019t I conclude that I too should uproot me and my family\u2019s life and move somewhere where I can constantly help? The core thinking here being that if I want to help out with a particular cause\u2026the MOST good I could ever do is to be something like a Mother Theresa dedicating every second that I have.\u00a0At this point Peter Singer would probably direct your attention back to that amazing and very unique life that you were born into\u2026 and he\u2019d say\u2026that because of the tools you have at your disposal\u2026you can really do the MOST good\u2026by just being a highly productive citizen living in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s actually people out there that are much more extreme than Peter Singer that say that we, as citizens with this sort of opportunity available to us, we have a moral obligation to work really hard towards making MORE money in our careers, so that we can give all of that additional money to these causes. Again, that\u2019s a more extreme position to take\u2026but the sentiment still remains in Peter Singer\u2019s point.\u00a0\u00a0What he\u2019s saying is: sure you could quit your job, move to Africa, and spend all day every day handing out sack lunches to people\u2026or you could continue living your life as you do, and eventually donate enough money for a charity to employ\u2026three aid workers\u2026five aid workers\u2026.all of which are going to do the same job you would have done, but that didn\u2019t have this unique opportunity like you do\u2026to have their skills pay for the work of multiple people.\u00a0\u00a0Another common argument people will come back with is: ok, so I want to help\u2026I want to sacrifice so that other people don\u2019t have to die. Why do I even need to be comfortable? Why would any comfort of modern existence ever be more important than those dollars being spent to potentially save another life? Why shouldn\u2019t I go all in and donate every penny I possibly can? Why Shouldn\u2019t I live in a box? Why shouldn\u2019t I eat once a week and in between meals crush up some rocks and water into a thick paste that serves as a benign mass inside my stomach tricking it into thinking that I am full? Why shouldn\u2019t I do that?\u00a0Again, because you were born into a such a unique set of circumstances, one where you can use your opportunity to work to contribute truckloads of money to these causes\u2026it actually is counterproductive for you to not be comfortably living. It\u2019s a little bit like when they say on a plane\u2026secure your oxygen mask before you secure the mask of the child next to you. The thinking being\u2026if you're not breathing\u2026it\u2019s probably going to inhibit your oxygen mask fastening abilities. Now in the same way\u2026if you\u2019re weak and mentally foggy because you\u2019re not getting your caloric needs met, if you\u2019re sick because you get your drinking water from that communal hose on the side of your apartment complex\u2026even if you\u2019re not able to maintain a professional veneer and follow the dress code of your workplace\u2026all of these things inhibit your ability to make money to donate\u2026if in fact you wanted to truly do the most good you could possibly do.\u00a0Another argument that people commonly give is that, look everything you\u2019re saying is true\u2026I WANT to donate\u2026but unfortunately\u2026another thing that makes the time period I live in unique is that we live in a world where charities are often wasteful, ineffective or even downright corrupt. I wish I could give my money more directly so that it doesn\u2019t have to go through this middle man where I have no idea if the funds are actually going to the people I want to help!\u00a0It\u2019s a good point. There was a poll that Peter Singer cites in his book\u202670% of Americans that give to charity do absolutely ZERO research into where the money is actually going\u2026and around 29% of that remaining thirty do a very cursory look over of things, usually looking for a single criteria to be met\u2026like what percentage of the money actually goes to the people vs. administrative costs. But even THAT statistic can be misleading\u2026even though it sounds great oh, they\u2019re giving 98% of all money to the actual people in need\u2026often times\u2026the fact that they only use 2% to cover administrative costs makes them less effective at providing the help than some other charity that used say 5%\u2026also, because they have such a low budget to operate on\u2026often times the service they\u2019re providing isn\u2019t the most effective way to help the people they want to help.\u00a0\u00a0For example\u2026imagine a charity that has a very low operating cost and they use 2% percent of the money to travel to places where people are dying of Malaria and give them Malaria vaccine\u2026pretty simple operation\u2026versus ANOTHER charity that sends teams of people to these communities and teaches everyone how to make their own nets that prevent mosquitos from biting them in the first place. Now, the second operation might cost a bit more to execute, but think of how much more GOOD is being done as a result of it.\u00a0So no question it can be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to finding what charities are actually going to be doing good, but again\u2026a hallmark of the time period that we live in is that we have access to information. There are independent groups that do nothing but audit charities\u2026exposing any waste\u2026exposing any corruption\u2026showing where every dollar goes\u2026they even give them a ranking so you can see very quickly which ones are actually doing good. Again, this goes back to the \u201ceffective\u201d part of effective altruism\u2026it\u2019s not enough to have a knee-jerk emotional response to something\u2026we need to be willing to do a little digging to find out what organization is going to do the most good with our money.\u00a0But probably THE MOST common argument that people give back when they\u2019re faced with this thought experiment about the little girl dying in front of the restaurant\u2026is that it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help\u2026for me it\u2019s the problem of: how much good can I actually do? I mean, I\u2019m not a billionaire\u2026I don\u2019t have millions of dollars to be throwing around\u2026yeah I COULD give a dollar a month five dollars a month\u2026but how much good is that actually doing?\u00a0\u00a0Well what if\u2026five million people had that same outlook? There\u2019s the millions of dollars that could have made a huge impact. By the way real quick\u2026I\u2019m walking proof of how big of a difference the dollar\u2026five dollar donations make. I pay my bills and survive from the one\u2026two dollars an episode that people give on Patreon\u2026so for all of you out there that didn\u2019t say, oh what good could I possibly do\u2026thank you because you make this show possible.\u00a0\u00a0The same dynamic applies to people dying in developing countries. You know Peter Singer talks about how\u2026were born into a world that tells us hard work is a virtue\u2026and the paradigm that you\u2019re supposed to strive for is to make more money\u2026so that you can spend more money. You know, it\u2019s exciting when you get a raise at work or when grandma beatrice leaves you a huge inheritance because now\u2026you get to buy that nicer car you\u2019ve always wanted\u2026you get to have a bigger and better house\u2026you make more\u2026to be able to spend more. But what often happens is you find yourself on this hedonic treadmill where you\u2019re always thinking about what you\u2019re going to buy next and once you get it\u2026it\u2019s onto the NEXT thing you\u2019re going to buy\u2026and so on and so forth until you realize that the stuff is never going to bring you satisfaction\u2026the satisfaction has to come from the inside.\u00a0\u00a0Peter Singer asks\u2026why does it have to be this way? Why, hypothetically speaking, couldn\u2019t we live in a world where we have the same idea that hard work is a virtue\u2026but instead of making more so that you can spend more\u2026you make more so that you can give more?\u00a0When it\u2019s all said and done\u2026you\u2019re 80 years old\u2026you\u2019re looking back on your life\u2026Peter Singer would ask you\u2026which would you rather look back on\u2026a lifetime where you made tons of money you didn\u2019t need and bought stuff you didn\u2019t need\u2026stuff that\u2019s all sitting in a landfill somewhere now\u2026or would you rather look back and say\u2026I made more money that I needed and with that money I was able to save 100,000 lives. 100,000 people are alive today that otherwise would have died\u2026and that\u2019s because of me\u2026that\u2019s because of this guy.\u00a0Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time.\u00a0\u00a0"
