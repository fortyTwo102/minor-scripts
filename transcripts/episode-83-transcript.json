Check out the episode page HERE.\u00a0\u00a0Henry David Thoreau was an American author and philosopher who in the year 1845 resigned himself from public life to a shack, in the woods, next to a lake\u2026for two years, two months and two days of his life. Why? Well if you wanted to get a little closer to finding out why\u2026 might not be a bad idea to visit the actual shack that he lived in! You can do it! Well, it\u2019s a replica shack\u2026they rebuilt the shack\u2026but you CAN visit the actual site where he built his shack before it got torn down\u2026they found the hearth or the bottom of the fireplace buried just under the dirt and from there they extrapolated where the rest of the cabin had to have been\u2026but the fact remains\u2026to this day\u2026 you can go to concord Massachusetts and stand on the exact spot where Thoreau stood\u2026you can see the actual views that he writes about\u2026you can close your eyes and listen and if you can drown out the sound of the SUVs and motorcycles passing by just behind you can hear many of the same things he heard. Let\u2019s say you did it. Let\u2019s say you did visit Walden Pond in today\u2019s world\u2026what you\u2019d see\u2026are narrow trails\u2026 fairly dense woods all around you\u2026and when you approached the actual site where Thoreau built his cabin you\u2019d come to a clearing and you\u2019d see a big piece of wood staring you in the face\u2026and etched into this piece of wood is one of the most iconic lines from his famous account of his time out there and it goes like this: \u201cI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201d Do you ever worry about that? Do you ever worry about what he\u2019s talking about here? Waking up one morning\u202650 60 years old and having an epiphany about life that had been staring you in the face your whole life and if only you had done things just a little differently you would have realized it when you were twenty and not wasted decades of your life? Well I do. I worry about that stuff all the time. Kind of a strange thing to worry about\u2026the worry doesn\u2019t really solve anything\u2026all it really does is keep you motivated to keep thinking about life and your place in the world so that at least if you DO wake up 60 years old and realize you\u2019ve wasted it all\u2026at least you put in all the work you could have. Well, Thoreau seems to be of a similar mindset\u2026he wants to live deliberately\u2026which it seems by that quote is a very active process and he wants to do this\u2026so that he doesn\u2019t come to the end of his life and realize that he never lived at all. Now, I don't think many people would disagree that they don\u2019t want to come to the end of their life and feel like they wasted it\u2026the confusion that most people have about that quote is his method of achieving that. Yeah, I don\u2019t want to waste my life either\u2026but when I'm brainstorming all the ways I'm gonna try to prevent that from happening\u2026I don\u2019t arrive at the conclusion that we should go camping for two years. Why would Thoreau go to the woods to accomplish that? Well make no mistake\u2026the lessons that Thoreau learned in this little unassuming cabin of his would go on to change the lives of untold numbers of people, not to mention his own. But to understand why he landed on the woods\u2026in particular\u2026I want to briefly talk about two things that are going to help set the stage\u2026one is the psychology of Thoreau living during the time that he did\u2026and the other is the approach to life commonly known as Transcendentalism. So let\u2019s get right into it: long before Thoreau ever decided to isolate himself at Walden Pond\u2026he knew he didn\u2019t really fit in\u2026with the rest of the kids on the playground. He just didn\u2019t think about things the same way as the average person that was living back then. And you'll find example after example of this if you just take a quick look at his life. For example, Thoreau had just graduated from college\u2026went to Harvard\u2026and he must of been under a tremendous amount of pressure from himself\u2026his family to make this degree he just worked so hard for to actually do something for him\u2026and he gets a job as a school teacher. Well the policy of the school at the time\u2026what the majority of the community of people he was serving wanted him to do if the kids start misbehaving is to use corporal punishment to keep them in line. Thoreau, living during a time when that kind of thing was acceptable\u2026didn\u2019t like it\u2026so he quit his job. Thoreau was a conservationist during a time when we didn\u2019t have grisly images of evil corporations sawing down acres of trees leaving pandas with no where to live. He saw the environmental writing on the wall before most people even realized it could POTENTIALLY be a problem. Thoreau was a huge opponent of slavery\u2026during a time when people owned slaves all around him and weren\u2019t being morally denounced for doing so. Point is: given where society has gone since his day and age\u2026Thoreau seemed to be way ahead of his time. But whether he KNEW he was right or wrong or not\u2026he still has to live in a world surrounded by people that don\u2019t see any problem with this stuff. Now this raises a very important question if you're Thoreau\u2026what do you do about it? What do you do about the fact that you live in a society that endorses all kinds of stuff that you think is immoral? Not an easy question to answer\u2026after all\u2026you\u2019re just one citizen\u2026why are you so special? Should the rest of the country have to bend to your will so that you get what you want? And the extension of that is\u2026democracy is majority rule\u2026do you have an obligation to your fellow citizens to go along with what the majority has deemed to be morally acceptable? On the other hand, you might feel the exact opposite! You might feel like if you see something going on that you think is wrong\u2026you might feel like you have an obligation to NOT keep quiet. You need to stand up for what you believe in and change the world! This was not an easy question to answer for Thoreau early in his life. But then something changed. Then it became really easy to answer that question\u2026probably the strongest conviction Thoreau held throughout the latter stages of his life. And the seed that was planted\u2026that would eventually grow into this strong belief about the answer to this question\u2026was when Thoreau read an essay that was written by a good friend of his named Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2026and the title of this essay was Self-Reliance. Self Reliance was an essay that called for everyone who read it to understand the importance of being, well\u2026self reliant. But maybe a better way of putting it is that it called on people to understand the value of being an individual. Emerson writes: \u201cThere comes a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion.\u201d What Emerson is saying here is that as a human being, we\u2019re born into this very unique condition where we need to find out who we are. We need to find out what we care about\u2026what kind of person were going to be\u2026what sort of legacy we\u2019re going to leave behind us. The problem is\u2026none of us are born with a full understanding of what that\u2019s going to be\u2026so an alluring trap that people fall into is to look around them and just conform to the way that other people act. Certainly gives you a quick and easy answer to the question of what you\u2019re going to be\u2026unfortunately\u2026as Emerson says\u2026imitation is suicide\u2026you going around doing your best imitation of what the people around you are doing in the interest of avoiding a difficult conversation with yourself\u2026is effectively suicide\u2026suicide of your individuality. No, self-reliance preaches a sort of radical non-conformity. Anyone who just blindly believes anything that\u2019s told to them or just blindly goes along with whatever people are doing around them\u2026are foolish to Emerson. Maybe the best way to do this crazy thing called life\u2026is to figure it out for yourself\u2026go out and find your OWN way. See, Thoreau and Emerson are living in a world where advances in science and philosophy show that this thing that we call objective truth\u2026is a pretty slippery thing to define\u2026if not entirely impossible for us to ever arrive at. So as a response to this\u2026what Transcendentalism does\u2026and self-reliance espouses Transcendentalist ideas\u2026is it takes ideas from all over the world at various different points throughout history\u2026There are ideas from Romanticism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Vedism, even further east to Confucianism\u2026it takes all these ideas and creates an approach to life that\u2019s not just about living wisely\u2026but that ultimately that wisdom is something that you as an individual need to arrive at yourself\u2026that inside of everyone there is a genius of sorts\u2026the infinitude of the individual as Emerson writes\u2026and that maybe you should trust your own thought\u2026more than the thought of people that are considered \u201cwise\u201d by other people around you\u2026maybe what we should all be aiming for is not objective truth about the way things are\u2026but a personal truth about the way things are. Now at this point a certain type of person starts nodding emphatically\u2026slowly clapping. Yes. What\u2019s true for me\u2026is not true for you. This is MY truth. Yes, I believe that the ghost of a witch that was wrongly convicted in the 1700\u2019s is haunting the property lines of my house\u2026but that\u2019s MY truth. I\u2019m impervious to criticism! No, it shouldn\u2019t be like this. It shouldn\u2019t be some get out of jail free card to not take the process seriously and then wave it around whenever someone tries to tell you what you believe is ridiculous. No doubt it will be used this way\u2026but the point of the personal truth is to accept the illusive nature of objective truth and show who the onus is truly on\u2026.YOU! This truth is yours and yours alone\u2026the only people it should affect should be you and the people you care about\u2026think of how important your personal pursuit of truth becomes in that world. Now if this is what you believe\u2026one of the things that naturally goes along with that\u2026is that one of the worst things you can do is just look around you\u2026 see how other people are acting\u2026 and just blindly copy whatever it is they\u2019re doing. You\u2019re not working to try to figure it out on your own\u2026you\u2019re not trying to arrive at a better personal truth with that strategy\u2026you\u2019re just trying to get by. You\u2019re just killing time in a waiting room\u2026but for what? What are you killing time and waiting for\u2026death? Ralph Waldo Emerson thinks that \u201csociety is in conspiracy against the manhood of its members\u201d\u2026and what he means by that is that civilization\u2026these societies that we live in with our cities and our culdesacs and our farmers markets and all these activities that have us in close quarters with each other bound together by a social contract\u2026these things PROMOTE this mentality of being a passive, quiet, drone that just conforms with everything going on around them and is protected from the baptism of having to take your views about the world to task. In other words, the same way society protects the physically lazy\u2026it also protects the mentally lazy. Society, for all the good stuff it seemingly does for us\u2026it may be the BIGGEST boulder in the way if you\u2019re truly someone that wants to try to live deliberately. This is why\u2026Thoreau removes society from his life. And it wasn\u2019t long after he read Emerson\u2019s self reliance that he went to his friend Emerson and asked if he could live in a shack on his property in concord Massachusetts\u2026at which point Emerson said\u2026what have I done\u2026look when i wrote the essay i didn\u2019t really anticipate everyone coming and wanting to live on MY property\u2026it was more of like a personal property thing\u2026like your PERSONAL truth. Just kidding he let him. Now as you can imagine, this move to the wilderness seems like it must have been a pretty big shock to Thoreau\u2019s system\u2026i mean, to go from all of the comforts of modern living to just having a desk a couple chairs and a bed\u2026must have been a pretty rough adjustment phase, right? Well the reality was\u2026no\u2026it was actually kind of nice. See, Thoreau realized something as he was thinking about all the ways society is in \u201cconspiracy against the individuality of its members.\u201d He realized the more you own\u2026the more your stuff owns you. He said we often find ourselves not totally happy\u2026not feeling a strong sense of self worth\u2026we think about what we think might bring us that self worth\u2026and a trap that a lot of people fall into is they look OUTSIDE of themselves for the answers to whats going on on the inside of themselves. He says we tell ourselves this lie that oh, if only i get that new pair of shoes or if only I get that car I want then everything's going to be great! But he says what we should realize\u2026is that even if you were trapped like a lost hiker underneath an avalanche of new shoes\u2026YOU would still be there. All of the negative mental holding patterns that contribute to that lack of self worth are still there\u2026you just now have a nike symbol imprinted into your forehead. This goes beyond just stuff by the way\u2026it\u2019s interesting he and Emerson talk about how people often do this with travel. You know they say whats going to finally make me feel right? When I can travel the world and meet all kinds of people and see these different cultures\u2026that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna fix it. But just like the other example\u2026he says whether you\u2019re in China or Russia or India or where ever\u2026the common thread in all three of those examples\u2026is you. The solution to your problem is inside of you\u2026not a lack of some special thing outside of you. And this is just one of the many lessons he learns by removing society from his life and just opening his eyes to what\u2019s going on around him in nature. This is one of the hallmarks of Thoreau\u2019s work: there\u2019s a wisdom in nature\u2026if you\u2019re creative and can spot it. There\u2019s a beautiful passage where he talks about\u2026you know\u2026what happens when a chestnut and an acorn fall on the ground right next to each other in the dirt? Does one of them yield to the other one? Does one decide to just not grow so the other one can grow? No, they both live in accordance with their respective natures until one day one of them overpowers the other one and it dies\u2026one things for sure\u2026regardless of whatever adversity was thrown that chestnut\u2019s way\u2026it was a chestnut through and through until the day it died. Not some facsimile of an acorn or a juniper bush or a geranium\u2026it was a chesnut\u2026and in that sense\u2026we as people can learn a lot from that chestnut about how to live life. You know, personally\u2026something I use as a means of cultivating acceptance about things that are out of my control is actually a reworking of an idea Thoreau had in Walden! You know, I live in the Pacific Northwest and if there\u2019s something there\u2019s a lot of up here it\u2019s meth and trees. So no matter what direction I\u2019m facing\u2026pretty good chance there\u2019s always going to be a tree within eyeshot. Think of trees not as plants for a second\u2026think of them as living things that have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now how do you survive for hundreds and hundreds of years\u2026you gotta be doing something right. Well consider the fact that 24 hours a day seven days a week\u2026while you\u2019re sleeping\u2026working\u2026watching Netflix\u2026constantly\u2026these trees are met with the ceaseless onslaught of the elements. Rain, wind, snow, lightning\u2026here are these wise elders\u2026these living things that deal with that adversity\u2026constantly\u2026and how do they do it? They sway. They sway in the wind. Gently back and forth. If they resist it too much, they break\u2026if they don\u2019t resist enough they have no foundation\u2026they have no roots. What a cool metaphor for how we might approach the ceaseless onslaught of adversity the world throws our way. Anyway, I highly recommend Walden pond if this stuff fascinates you, but Thoreau accomplished his goal when he was out there for two years. He comes back to society looks around him and more clearly than ever before sees not individuals, but passive, ignorant subjects that constantly seek for others to define who they are in exchange for the crumbs of security that society provides them. He says man, isn\u2019t it crazy\u2026that when people are given the freedom to be anyone they want to be\u2026they end up just acting like everyone else. This isn\u2019t life\u2026this is the opposite of life\u2026he says a scarecrow can do everything these people are doing\u2026but this is what the tendency is when we all decide to congregate around each other and conform to society. \u201cMost of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only indispensable, but positive hinderances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.\u201d I guess another upside to Thoreau spending all this time away from people its that he found an answer to that question we talked about at the beginning of the episode\u2026you know whether we\u2019re obligated to keep quiet and be respectful of the majority, or whether we\u2019re obligated to speak up and change things for the better. Well you can probably guess his answer to this now\u2026of course we should speak up! We should never just passively go along and conform to what people are doing around us. Now this in itself is far from a novel concept\u2026but what IS novel\u2026probably the most influential idea given to us by Henry David Thoreau\u2026one that would go on to shape the hunger strikes of India and Mahatma Ghandi\u2026it would go on to shape the civil rights movement in America and countless other movements\u2026it wasn\u2019t THAT we should stand against society if it doesn\u2019t stand for what is morally right\u2026but HOW we should go about standing up to society. He wrote a book called \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d\u2026the opening line of which cites the quote \u201cthe government that governs best, governs least.\u201d now often misattributed to Thomas Jefferson. But keep in mind\u2026what Thoreau is saying there is not that the smallest government is the best government\u2026he\u2019s saying the government should be as simple as possible, but not any simpler and not any more complex than is necessary. See Thoreau realized that majority rule is by its very nature coercive to the individual. This wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal if it didn\u2019t force that individual to live in a society that doesn\u2019t go along with their conscience or beliefs. \u201c. . . the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live under a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free [free in his thinking], fancy-free, imagination-free, that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him.\u201d In other words, as long as you\u2019re living a life that corresponds with your conscience and beliefs about things\u2026nothing can really bother you! So how do we accomplish that given the unfortunate state of affairs that the coercive nature of majority rule often forces us to not live that life\u2026what do we do about it? Well if you\u2019re expecting Thoreau to say to grab your pitchforks and head down to city hall\u2026you got another thing coming. In fact, he doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s your duty to actively lobby for change much at all. \u201cIt is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too.\u201d So Thoreau\u2019s position here is even more nuanced than just \u201cstand up for what you believe in and write a letter to your congressman!\u201d No, he makes it really clear at multiple points in Civil Disobedience\u2026look I have a lot of other stuff to do\u2026I didn\u2019t come into this world to make this a good place to live in\u2026but simply just to live in the world as an individual\u2026whether thats a good place or a bad place. So the question then becomes, if it happens to be a bad place when you\u2019re here\u2026how can the individual still continue to live freely and deliberately\u2026 without having to feel morally guilty by association to all of these bad things going on? Thoreau\u2019s answer to this question is Civil Disobedience. He asks a really interesting question at the beginning of the book: why do we necessarily need to have the government meddling in issues of morality? Look the government has a lot of stuff on their plate in addition to having to be the moral arbiter of the United States Thoreau would say\u2026they gotta fix our crumbling roads and bridges\u2026they have to collect taxes\u2026why not give them a break? Better question is: why is the government in the business of legislating morality? The government\u2019s great at doing some stuff\u2026maybe not so much when it comes to morality. Thoreau seems to think that the government \u201chas not the vitality and force of a single living man.\u201d No the individual is central to any progression\u2026and this centrality of the individual is one of the most profound ideas he\u2019d ever give us: in the same way if you\u2019re feeling really bad on the inside\u2026the solution is going to come from you as an individual, not some outside intervention\u2026so too in issues of morality\u2026it\u2019s the INDIVIDUAL that is central to reform\u2026not government intervention or coercion. Best thing we can do?\u2026to Thoreau? Non-violent protest. Now living in an age where we\u2019ve seen non violent protest play out so seamlessly over the years\u2026it may be tough to put ourselves in the shoes of the people living back then where it wasn\u2019t an obvious option that they could go to in times of political strife\u2026but really\u2026during this time and overwhelmingly throughout human history\u2026the torch and pitchfork approach was the go to method if you wanted to get something done. Here\u2019s Thoreau offering a different solution. For example, Thoreau lived during the generation that gave rise to the Mexican-American war\u2026now it was commonly seen at the time that this was a war not based on any sort of moral foundation\u2026it wasn't a necessary war\u2026it was a war waged for the economic expediency that came along with the eventual expansion of slave trading to a larger territory. Now if you\u2019re Thoreau\u2026staunch opponent to slavery\u2026how can you in good conscience pay taxes and support a system that is taking those tax dollars and waging a war that is nurturing the positive growth of slavery as an institution? Well you can\u2019t. So Thoreau\u2026didn\u2019t. He stopped paying taxes in protest of the state getting involved in issues of morality that he thought it really had no business being a part of. The beauty of this is that if enough people follow suit, the state no longer has the resources to fund the Mexican-American war. Now the significance of this is: for this change to come\u2026no one had to bomb city hall or punch anyone in the face or worst of all\u2026start a hashtag\u2026no this civil disobedience has brought about a \u201cpeaceable revolution\u201d. Yeah, Thoreau went to jail for not paying his taxes, but he didn\u2019t see that as being so much of a bad thing. In fact, he saw it as the only way to truly be an individual. Sure he could\u2019ve pouted\u2026paid his taxes\u2026complained to everyone around him\u2026publicly attacked the leadership of the war\u2026but he\u2019d be doing all of this\u2026all the while he would be monetarily contributing to a system that didn\u2019t correspond with his conscience. It\u2019s really interesting as we talk about these different economic models and systems of government\u2026no question we\u2019ve talked about at least one that you don\u2019t agree with or that you think is immoral. Well try to put yourself in the shoes of Thoreau here: Thoreau\u2026in a weird way\u2026went to jail\u2026in order to be truly free. Not the other way around. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time."
