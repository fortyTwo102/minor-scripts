    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #105\u00a0on Sartre. Check out the episode page HERE.So in a culture where there\u2019s so much social currency connected to being a victim\u2026 and having some burden that you carry around with you throughout your life\u2026there may be some of you out there that feel a little left out\u2026maybe you\u2019re the kind of person, you look at yourself\u2026and you don\u2019t feel like a victim\u2026maybe you don\u2019t sit around poised waiting to make other people aware of some bad thing that happened to you in the past\u2026well ENOUGH of that crazy talk, get off the bench because your uncle steve\u2019s putting you in the game. I\u2019m here to tell you\u2026Rest assured my friend\u2026you ARE a victim. Turns out, we\u2019re ALL victims just by virtue of being born because just\u2026think\u2026for a second about how horrible the world was for us\u2026when we were all babies.Think of what it\u2019s like being a baby, imagine going through something similar today and if you made it out the other side TELL me you wouldn\u2019t be part of some sort of advocacy group for the people that are currently going through it.Think about it\u2026you didn\u2019t CHOOSE to be born. Imagine being rounded up against your will and being rocketed off to some alien planet you know nothing about. You find yourself once you get on that planet\u2026absorbed into some tribe\u2026you don\u2019t speak the language\u2026you have no idea what anything is\u2026you think the remote control to their TV is food\u2026and you\u2019re completely defenseless.And who do you have as teachers, on this journey? What\u2026just some random man and woman that happen to look like you? They didn\u2019t go to school for this stuff\u2026being a baby is like going to the world\u2019s worst community college where they don\u2019t even have teachers\u2026they just pull some random people off the street and say \u201cteach these kids about rocket science, GO!\u201d Except it\u2019s worse than that\u2026we\u2019re not just learning about rocket science\u2026we\u2019re learning everything about what it is to exist. How we look at other people, how we look at the world, how we look at our selves within that world.\u00a0What I\u2019m saying is: the struggle for us former babies\u2026was real. And I think it\u2019s safe to say that when you\u2019re living in the middle of this chaotic world as a baby just trying to figure things out\u2026no one\u2019s really blaming you for just sort of going along with a lot of the ways people were doing things around you. There\u2019s a lot to figure out, and a lot of these ways we\u2019ve LEARNED to make sense of this stuff is totally arbitrary. A lot of the ways that we think about stuff\u2026have been just sort of, almost by accident, PASSED DOWN from generation to generation.Philosophers realized this\u2026and at the time of Sartre, for over 300 years people had been pointing out\u2026 how MANY of the ways we look at things in the western world are largely derivative\u2026 from the way Christianity describes being a human being. That\u2019s how entrenched religion was in the lives of people back then\u2026and that even if you\u2019ve never been to church, even if your family\u2019s 15 generations removed from ever stepping foot in a church\u2026 some of these things are so foundational, that generation after generation of confused baby trying to figure things out\u2026just went along with certain assumptions about existence that have their origins in Christianity, for example.There\u2019s a certain revelatory way that a lot of people look at important crossroads in life. Right, like for example they\u2019ll say\u2026ok, so I need to choose a career path for my life, I need to declare a major. Big decision\u2026what do I do? Well whenever I think about it I just don\u2019t, know what I want I certainly have it narrowed down to a few options\u2026but I just can\u2019t make that big decision. I don\u2019t know exactly what I want, and yeah, I don\u2019t spend that much time thinking about it, but I have faith it\u2019s gonna come to me. I have faith that I\u2019m gonna wake up one day somethings gonna happen to me, some life event\u2026and then I\u2019m gonna know. I\u2019m gonna realize my calling in life in that moment.People do this same thing with relationships. They\u2019ll say I have this vague idea up in my head of my one and only someone\u2026don\u2019t know EXACTLY what they look like what they\u2019re gonna be like\u2026but I\u2019m confident\u2026one day I\u2019m gonna meet someone\u2026 and there\u2019s gonna be this moment when I look at them and I realize they\u2019re the person I wanna spend the rest of my life with. People do this with anything\u2026they\u2019ll do it with motivational videos on YouTube\u2026one day I\u2019m gonna watch the right person screaming at me to be better\u2026 and from then on out it\u2019s gonna be EASY to go to the gym and eat pine cones for the rest of my life\u2026in other words: there\u2019s a certain revelatory way that some people look at life choices\u2026 that some thinkers believe is a long lost relic of the revelatory way we used to think about the nature of existence. That a reasonable expectation to have when navigating your life\u2026is that one day you\u2019re going to wake up\u2026and there\u2019s going to be some event\u2026some miracle that you witness some transcendent moment\u2026 where you realize the divinity of Jesus and if you have any further questions about the nature of existence just forward them to the Pope\u2019s inbox. That\u2019s a REASONABLE thing to expect, in that worldview.Well this isn\u2019t the only\u2026example of these long lost remnants of Christianity in our thinking. And another major one\u2026 another one that a LOT of people in today\u2019s world still use to make sense of things\u2026is the way that they look at themselves and who they are. Just like in Christianity\u2026where yes you have a body\u2026but your TRUE self\u2026 is a soul, it\u2019s an eternal spirit hidden deep down within that body that YOU have an intimate access to\u2026just like that, a lot of people in today\u2019s world think of their true SELF\u2026or the answer to the question: who are you? As a personality\u2026 hidden deep within us that only we and our closest friends have access to\u2026you know they\u2019ll say things like sure\u2026when I\u2019m out in public I DO kind of put on a mask for the sake of social utility, I admit it. I don\u2019t act like my 100% TRUE self in the Starbucks drivethru\u2026I tell people things they want to hear, I play the game because look\u2026 fact is: it\u2019s just not useful, not to mention I don\u2019t really feel comfortable giving 100% of my true self to the person in the Starbucks drivethrough. Who am I really? Well that\u2019s something I reserve for my closest friends. In fact even some of my closest friends don\u2019t know everything about the depths of what it is to be me. Maybe for some of you out there\u2026there\u2019s only one other person in this entire WORLD that has full access to this TRUE SELF hidden deep within you.But Sartre would say, is this really how the self works? Is the self really like the Christian soul hidden somewhere deep within you that only you have access to? Sartre would say it very well may be that you put on a mask when you go to work for the sake of pragmatism\u2026and it very well may be that you\u2019ve reflected on yourself and you have this idea of who you are inside your head that\u2019s only accessed by you and your closest friends. But don\u2019t ignore the possibility that there are multiple levels of deception going on there. Maybe you\u2019re telling yourself a story you want to hear the same way you\u2019re telling the Starbucks barista a story.This concept is a common one in existentialism\u2026it\u2019s actually one of the main themes in Dostoyevsky\u2019s book Crime and Punishment\u2026the idea that, you know we often think we know a lot more about ourselves than we actually do. Two examples of this, bear with me for a second the first one\u2019s a little cartoonish\u2026 but I think it\u2019s a really good example to pull us out of this conditioned way we look at the self and it get\u2019s us to honestly start asking this question: where is this self that we\u2019re talking about REALLY located?Imagine a guy that thinks he\u2019s Napoleon. He spends all day every day dressing up in Parisian military garb, making a fort out of couch cushions in his front room, talking to himself agonizing over how he\u2019s going to conquer Moscow. Now this man believes beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is Napoleon. If you asked him candidly\u2026no but who are you really, deep down inside? He would say I am Napoleon Bonaparte. Commander of the armies of the north. Husband to a murdered wife, father to a murdered son. And I will have my vengeance. But is this man really Napoleon? WE know he\u2019s not Napoleon. In fact in a weird way, as outsiders, we seem to have an ADVANTAGE when it comes to knowing who he really is. Interesting.Here\u2019s the less cartoonish example and try to think about how this applies to you. Imagine a guy sitting on the couch watching the TV with his pals. They turn on the news and there\u2019s a story about a mass shooting that just happened at a Walmart somewhere. He hears the story, gets a little angry, turns to his friends and says you know what? That guy and people like him better HOPE he never shows up at my Walmart. Someone pulls out a gun when I\u2019m there, I\u2019m not gonna be one of those people on the news chopper camera screaming and running out of the store\u2026I\u2019m going to the Sporting Goods section. I\u2019m gonna go up into the rafters like I\u2019m Tom Cruise repel down and snap his neck. I\u2019m gonna do this\u2026because that\u2019s just the kind of person I am, that\u2019s me\u2026I\u2019d sacrifice my life for the greater good. Now he may tell his friends this\u2026he may believe that that is who he is deep down beyond a SHADOW of a doubt\u2026but if next Saturday he\u2019s out shopping with his family, someone pulls out a gun and all his wife and kids see is a poof of smoke and him running out the back door\u2026who is that guy REALLY?In other words: when we reference this thing we call our \u201cself\u201d. Intuitively it can feel like well I AM my self. I know who I am, so no one can tell me who I am but me. In fact if you just recited that statement in most public settings people would be like, YEAH! You tell \u2018em! Only YOU know who you are deep down inside! But is that a delusion? Is that just a narrative that we tell ourselves to simplify this concept of the self?Sartre says that when you take a closer look at the self...it\u2019s not a soul\u2026it\u2019s not a personality hidden deep within you\u2026what we\u2019re referencing when we talk about the self turns out to be much more complex than that with many more moving parts. And I think a good place to begin if we want to understand Sartre\u2019s views on what the self REALLY is\u2026is to talk about two foundational aspects of what it means to be a human being that to Sartre seem to be constantly intertwined and dependent upon each other\u2026what he calls our Facticity and our Transcendence.If you are a human being that is alive, right now\u2026you have both Facticity and Transcendence, put very simply: our Facticity is the collection of facts that are true about us at any given moment\u2026and Transcendence is our ability to change or the possibilities that we have at our disposal. Let\u2019s break it down further though: remember last time when we talked about being-in-itself vs being-for-itself? Being in itself as being kind of like matter\u2026this inert, featureless, blob of existence, fully affirmative. And being for itself as being consciousness\u2026or the source of all negation. Well when Sartre\u2019s trying to meet his monthly quota for obscure sounding philosophical descriptions\u2026the way he DESCRIBES the relationship between these two ontological categories is that being in itself: is what it is. And being for itself: is what it is not. Well as weird as that sounds in a vacuum, after listening to last episode we all know what he means when he says it.But then Sartre points out something very, mysterious\u2026a very strange coincidence. When you look at the relationship between these two ontological categories\u2026two things that are easy to write off as these meaningless abstract concepts that Sartre cooked up one day\u2026when you look at how being in itself and being for itself relate to eachother\u2026Sartre notices there seems to be a similar sort of relationship at the foundation of who we are as people.See because, on one hand, all of us have our Facticity\u2026.and Facticity is kind of like being in itself\u2026it\u2019s the fully affirmative set of facts that are true about us. You ask me who I am\u2026.and I say things like oh, well I\u2019m 117 years old, that\u2019s a fact. I am a horse wrangler by profession, that\u2019s a fact. I make 28,000 dollars per year, I drive a Ford Focus and I\u2019m scared of spiders, things like that. In other words, statements of facts that are currently true about us, this is what makes up our Facticity.But what Sartre would want us to consider\u2026is that while these kinds of statements are no doubt useful when it comes to describing certain pieces of who I am\u2026they never tell us the full story right? And the reason why is because human beings are far more complex than that\u2026to fully understand a human being\u2026just BY DEFAULT is to understand a type of being that has possibilities\u2026none of us are PURE Facticity\u2026the only time a human being is PURE Facticity is when they\u2019re DEAD\u2026yes, we have a set of facts that are true about us right now, but we ALWAYS have the ability to change into something else\u2026and if we\u2019re trying to describe a self\u2026if we\u2019re looking at the WHOLE picture of who someone is\u2026the choices we make about which of these possibilities we\u2019re going to bring about, end up being JUST as important as the facts about who we are right now, for example.If I\u2019m going to school to become an IT consultant\u2026or if I\u2019m training for a marathon\u2026or if I\u2019m losing a bunch of weight for wedding pictures\u2026a big part of understanding who I am is understanding the thing I\u2019m actively trying to change into\u2026an IT consultant, a marathon runner, the flower girl at a wedding. In other words, part of understanding the full picture of ME is understanding what I am not yet. You can start to hear the weird Sartre description creeping in\u2026just like being in itself is what it is and being for itself is what it is not\u2026in a sense\u2026I am what I am, I have a Facticity\u2026but I also am what I am not yet when I consider my transcendence.Just like being in itself and being for itself\u2026these two aspects of what it is to be a human being, Facticity and Transcendence, are entangled, intertwined and in some cases reliant on each other for their very existence. Your facticity and transcendence are constantly affecting each other\u2026and that\u2019s because the facts of your life are often times caused by what possibilities you decide to bring about and the possibilities you\u2019ve decided to explore are almost always limited by the FACTS of your life, let\u2019s stop with the hypotheticals and give a real example.Me. I\u2019ll use me as an example. I am six feet tall 172.2 pounds this morning. No matter HOW MUCH I want to\u2026I am never going to become a horse jockey. It\u2019s just not going to happen for me. As long as there are people out there that are 4\u20198\u201d 85 lbs\u2026the facticity that I\u2019m a certain height and weight limits my ability to transcend\u2026and the result of that is: I\u2019m never winning the Kentucky Derby. This is an example of how our ability to transcend is often times limited by the facts about us. Another example\u2026I was born with a particular face and a particular ability to put on muscle. No matter HOW MUCH I want to\u2026I am never going to be an Instagram model. The facticity of my face\u2026my faceticity\u2026and all the stuff that\u2019s going on there\u2026I will never be the kind of person that people voluntarily want to look at and click an emoji that signifies how they\u2019re feeling about the most recent picture of me. It\u2019s just not gonna happen and these facts about me are the parameters I live my life and exercise my freedom within.See because that\u2019s the thing, and this goes for all of you out there\u2026When Sartre talks about radical freedom\u2026when any of us talk about being individuals that are free to act as they choose\u2026we\u2019re never talking about TOTAL freedom\u2026right? It\u2019s always freedom within certain limitations. We often say things like, \u201cI can do whatever I want to do.\u201d But you can\u2019t REALLY do anything you want to do\u2026right, I mean ultimately you\u2019re a human being\u2026you can\u2019t wrap yourself in a protective cocoon and then emerge a unicorn in three days. You can\u2019t fly to the edge of the universe and look at what\u2019s on the other side. No, freedom is always freedom within certain limitations\u2026 and it\u2019s those limitations that give a LOT of what you choose to do in life it\u2019s value.We see this\u2026 in all the various different forms of art\u2026you know when someone writes a really good Haiku\u2026we see it as good NOT because they\u2019re the greatest words that could ever have possibly been strung together\u2026the beauty of the Haiku is because we understand that we have given an artist total freedom within a set of limitations that we impose. Five syllables, seven syllables, five syllables, go. In other words, the limitations are a big part of what makes the Haiku beautiful, and this applies to life as well.The facticity that you were born into, your own individual limitations are always going to affect the possibilities that you have and what you ultimately choose to do with your life. So try to live your life like it\u2019s a piece of art you\u2019re creating. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve just accepted that I\u2019m never gonna be an Instagram model..I mean, it\u2019s like anything you just learn to adjust. Like I literally wear all of my hooded sweatshirts backwards now\u2026so that if any field trips pass by any small children come around I can just pull it over my face, nobodies gotta get scared.. So yeah, you just find little ways\u2026but yeah, ultimately the point Sartre\u2019s going to make here with the concepts of Facticity and Transcendence\u2026is not only stop thinking about your self as though it\u2019s this artifact hidden deep within you in a vault, but also stop thinking about who you are as though it\u2019s this static, unchanging thing that you can point to.That who you are\u2026 is always in a state\u2026 of constant change, sometimes small changes, sometimes bigger changes, but always CHANGING and in flux. But don\u2019t go extreme in the other way\u2026don\u2019t start thinking of your self as this ethereal thing that can never be defined. Again, all the way up until the day you die\u2026 when you\u2019re finally turned into TOTAL Facticity\u2026you will always have certain facts that are true about you and certain possibilities at your disposal to bring about. Unless if you\u2019re dead\u2026you\u2019ve never arrived at a destination as a human being.Now at first glance this may seem like Sartre\u2019s writing a self help book. No single fact about you sums up who you are! Release your inner transcendence! No. Like we touched on last time Sartre thinks that when people are truly faced with the number of these possibilities they\u2019re free to choose from\u2026most of the time they don\u2019t get excited\u2026they\u2019re horrified by it. In fact most of the time once people realize this stuff\u2026Sartre thinks that the secret, covert desire of everyone whether they realize it or not\u2026is to escape this duality\u2026it\u2019s to turn themselves into either PURE facticity or PURE transcendence, or as Sartre says\u2026we all secretly want to become God.Let\u2019s talk about what he means by that. Think about the way followers of the Abrahamic religions have traditionally looked at God, what is it like to be God? Well God is perfect. God is in this moment everything he will ever be. If God had a job interview\u2026and the person asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019d change about yourself?\u201d God LITERALLY doesn\u2019t have an answer to that question. But then on the other hand\u2026God is all powerful\u2026with the snap of his fingers\u2026he can do\u2026anything, he wants to do. In other words, in this old style, traditional view of what God is\u2026on one hand\u2026God is perfect as he is\u2026PURE facticity. But on the other hand God is all powerful and capable of bringing about ANY possibility he wants\u2026in other words PURE transcendence. Sartre would say this is no coincidence\u2026.and it\u2019s also no coincidence that as people navigate their lives they have all sorts of tactics they use to turn themselves\u2026 either into somebody that ignores their possibilities and are PERFECT as they are right now\u2026or someone who ignores the very real unfortunate facts about who they are and stay lost in unattainable dreams their entire life.This is the context we needed to understand a concept we talked about well over a year ago on the one episode we did on Sartre. The primary tactic that people use in their lives to turn themselves into PURE Facticity or PURE transcendence like God\u2026is something that Sartre calls Bad Faith. Let\u2019s look at the most famous example of Bad Faith Sartre gives and because we already talked about it in the other episode, I\u2019ll keep it brief. Sartre talks about sitting in the middle of a caf\u00e9 in Paris watching a waiter as he does his job. You can imagine a waiter in the 1940\u2019s dressed up in his little outfit\u2026very upright, good posture, very proper\u2026he holds the tray in a particular way, he walks and changes direction in a very militaristic, particular way just like a good waiter does\u2026Sartre can\u2019t help but point out\u2026that this guy doesn\u2019t seem to be a \u201cself\u201d with Facticity and Transcendence in this moment\u2026he seems to have relegated himself to just, playing the part of a waiter. He\u2019s going through the motions turning himself into pure facticity\u2026just a waiter and nothing else.Now even though waiters don\u2019t act like this often in today\u2019s world\u2026go to most restaurants and you can find some modern version of what Sartre\u2019s talking about here\u2026there\u2019s so many servers out there that have fallen into bad faith and are just sort of playing the role of this same person that seems to be the modern archetype of what it is to be a server\u2026they all say the same stuff: Hi, I\u2019m John I\u2019m gonna be taking care of you today. Can I get you guys started with a bottomless bucket of shrimp or some drinks? Later on, How\u2019s everything tasting for you? You save room for desert? I\u2019m just gonna leave this here absolutely no rush on the check I\u2019m gonna be over here I\u2019ll take a looksy back at you\u2026ask yourself: is this the way this guy talks to his mom? Is this the way he talks to his best friends? No. He\u2019s fallen into bad faith and is just playing the part of a server.Now the point Sartre\u2019s making here is not that waiters need to be more creative, it\u2019s not about waiters. Sartre thinks that as human beings\u2026 we have a tendency to gravitate towards this trap\u2026 in ALL aspects of our life. We make PROCLAMATIONS about what we are! I am a stay at home mom, and that\u2019s my identity\u2026I am a Libertarian\u2026I am a Mormon and that\u2019s that\u2026what we\u2019re desperately trying to do is give ourselves an essence in a world where existence precedes essence.All of these things are just us wanting to think about our \u201cselves\u201d as some static thing set in stone\u2026 and run from the reality of the possibilities we have. When we take an honest look at the possibilities at our disposal, it terrifies us and produces a feeling called nausea\u2026and we use Bad Faith to quell this feeling of nausea. Now if all you ever read was Sartre\u2019s Being and Nothingness\u2026you might get the read from the book that this tendency we have to gravitate towards bad faith, is an inescapable condition of being a human being\u2026 and that even when we\u2019re self aware of the Bad Faith we\u2019re engaging in\u2026we\u2019re still engaging in bad faith. If all you ever read was the main text of Being and Nothingness, you might get that impression and it certainly sounds like a really sad picture\u2026but in one of the footnotes of Being and Nothingness Sartre alludes to a way out and perhaps to an ethics that he would write later in life. Well HE never writes an ethics, and it may be because he lifelong partner and fellow existentialist Simone De Beauvoir produces what many consider to be the greatest existentialist approach to ethics called The Ethics of Ambiguity. We\u2019ll talk all about it on the next episode.But enough of bad faith\u2026back to answering this question: who am I, really?Here\u2019s the thing. These concepts of Facticity and Transcendence we\u2019ve been talking about. When it comes to the facts that are true about you and the possibilities that you have\u2026those things aren\u2019t hidden somewhere deep down within you that only you have access to. You may have a particular perspective of the facts that are true about you\u2026 and the possibilities that you have, but not only do you have an incentive to slip into bad faith and tell yourself a story about them, Sartre would say: you don\u2019t have some privileged VIP access to the facts about you and the possibilities that you have\u2026hypothetically, any other person if they were diligent enough has access to your Facticity and Transcendence. In fact, just like the guy that tells himself that he\u2019s Napoleon\u2026 sometimes other people are better at telling us who we are than WE are.But how is this possible? The reason it\u2019s possible is because the self is not the Christian soul, to Sartre.Just like your Facticity and Transcendence\u2026what we\u2019re referencing when we talk about our \u201cselves\u201d\u2026 is outside of us. It\u2019s an abstraction. It\u2019s the conglomeration of all of the things you\u2019ve ever actually done in your life. When you want to get a solid answer to the question: who am I? You don\u2019t reference the story that you tell yourself that\u2019s clouded by all sorts of\u2026 bad faith and wishful thinking like the guy that thinks he would try to take down the gunman at Walmart\u2026no, we tell ourselves stories all the time\u2026 what follows from this is that the TRUE measure of your values, and who you really are\u2026is what you actually do\u2026it\u2019s the collection of what you\u2019ve actually done thus far in your life. And Sartre says when you stop looking at the \u201cself\u201d as though it\u2019s something inside of you\u2026and you start looking at it accurately as this abstraction that\u2019s outside of us\u2026what you inevitably start to realize is that it\u2019s impossible to ever get a full picture of who you are, without referencing the way that other people view you. More than that\u2026it\u2019s impossible to get a full picture of BEING without referencing other people\u2026and HERE\u2019S what he\u2019s getting at:So far when it comes to describing being\u2026 we\u2019ve been presented with being in itself and being for itself\u2026 but it\u2019s right here, FAIRLY LATE in being and nothingness\u2026 that Sartre lays out his third ontological category\u2026what he calls \u201cbeing-for-others\u201d. Let\u2019s talk about what he means. Sartre would say that an intrinsic part of what it is to be you\u2026 is existing alongside other people and all of the consequences that come along with that. This is Being-for-others\u2026now how does \u201cbeing-for-others\u201d affect my answer to the question: who am I?Well again, this concept of the self is outside of us it\u2019s an abstractrion\u2026 and what Sartre points out is that there are many aspects about who we are that are given to us by other people. For example, whether we\u2019re trustworthy or not. Whether or not you\u2019re a trustworthy person is an aspect of who you are that\u2019s mediated by other people, right? Whether I\u2019m a nice or mean person. I may think of myself as a nice person, but if every single other person I encounter all throughout my life says that I\u2019m mean, for all intents and purposes\u2026I am a mean person.This concept of the self, and how other people view us\u2026seem to be connected, but the flip side of it being that interconnected\u2026is that it leaves us in a perpetual state of being judged by the people around us. We\u2019re almost constantly being turned into PURE facticity in their mind. For example, have you ever been walking around self-conscious about the way you look? Maybe you just got a new pair of shoes and you think they look weird\u2026and as you\u2019re walking around you feel like every person that passes you is thinking, WOW. What were THEY thinking when they picked those shoes. This is obviously a person that doesn\u2019t care much about how they look\u2026in other words they\u2019re looking at you and they\u2019re turning you into an object in their subjective view of the world\u2026pure facticity\u2026you will henceforth be known as the weird shoes guy in that person\u2019s mind, this is constantly going on. But Sartre\u2019s not saying it\u2019s always bad, that being around other people is some sort of paranoid, everybody\u2019s thinking bad things about me all the time thing\u2026people very well may be thinking really good things about you all the time, the point that Sartre wants to make is that this dynamic\u2026of other people seeing you, putting you on trial and turning you into pure Facticity in their minds\u2026 is going on all the time simply by virtue of the fact that we exist alongside other people\u2026and that while the insights other people give us about who we are are no doubt valuable\u2026we have to be careful not to slip into bad faith on either side of this dynamic of being for others.What I mean is: just because somebody sees you wearing weird shoes one day doesn\u2019t mean that you are now \u201cweird shoes guy\u201d. In other words, don\u2019t slip into bad faith when it comes to what people think about you\u2026no matter how convenient it is to prescribe yourself an essence and deny your transcendence\u2026don\u2019t turn yourself into PURE facticity and accept what other people tell you you are. Maybe you are weird shoes guy right now, but you don\u2019t HAVE to be in the future. But the other side of that, is don\u2019t deny your facticity and tell yourself that you don\u2019t care what anyone else says and that what other people think of you doesn\u2019t matter at all. That\u2019s slipping into another kind of bad faith.So to sum this up\u2026intuitively, it may seem to us like we have a special access to knowing who we are\u2026 and that we choose to share ourselves only with our closest friends who we trust. But Sartre would say the reason it seems this way is that what you actually have is a narrative about yourself, forged from a particular biased perspective, and that the reason it seems like your friends reinforce this picture of who you are\u2026is because the very criteria that we all use to choose who our friends are going to be\u2026is whether or not they reinforce this picture that we have of ourselves.That\u2019s what we \u201clike\u201d about our friends, to Sartre. For example, if a BIG part of the way you view your self\u2026 is that you consider yourself a smart person\u2026Sartre would predict\u2026 that most of your friends are going to be people that are not so smart that tell you that you\u2019re smart all the time, or people that ask you a lot of questions that you then answer, making you FEEL smart, or other smart people that commend you on being so smart like them. We choose our friends because they reinforce the way that we view ourselves, of COURSE we we\u2019d give them privileged access to our biased narrative of ourselves, and of course it\u2019s going to feel validating.Of course it would seem\u2026that you know better than anyone who you are\u2026but again, Sartre would say that the TRUE measure of your values, the TRUE answer to the question: who are you?\u2026is what you actually do. Thank you for listening. I\u2019ll talk to you next time."
