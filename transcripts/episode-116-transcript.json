    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #116 on Structuralism and Mythology. Check out the episode page HERE.So like we talked about last time, when structuralism bursts onto the scene in the early 20th century, there is an immediate shift in the way many thinkers view the traditional assumptions we've made about subjectivity. The idea that what you are is a free acting, independent subject sort of disinterestedly taking in the universe exploring the infinite options at your disposal...all of\u00a0 that starts to seem like an outdated, delusional way of viewing what it is to be a self. What it starts to look like is what you are...every preference, every habit, every belief that you hold is merely an expression, of rituals and structures of a culture that you happen to be occupying during your time here. The self doesn't shape the world, the world shapes the self.Now this is usually easy for people to get on board with when it comes to the little things. For example, the gestures we use. Like you can point out to someone that they wave at people when they greet them...and you can ask them: where exactly does that ritual come from? Where did you get the idea to move your hand back and forth at someone when you see them? I mean you didn't come out of the womb waving at everyone in the hospital...and you're certainly not the person that came up with the idea of waving. No, what happened was you were born into a culture that has a particular set of rituals. There was a time in your life when you didn't know anything about waving, but after seeing people wave at you over and over again as a form of greeting, eventually you added waving to your bag of tricks and now it's just part of you...it's what you do. If you were born into a different culture where waving wasn't a thing, you wouldn't have the slightest inclination at all to wave your hand in someones face when you greeted them.Now, practically no one sees that as a controversial statement to make. But people start to feel a little weird when a structuralist asks them, what if your taste in music is the same way? What if your favorite clothes and your favorite book and your favorite way to spend your evening are also just expressions of a culture you happened to be born into. What about your political viewpoints...your moral code...your views on the nature of existence, what if they're all the same way? To most people, these things feel very different than the cultural custom of waving...and the idea that they've just sort of picked these things up along the way...these things feel like they make up the totality of what it is to be me...see I've always seen myself as sort of a blank slate that is an autonomous self...I came into this universe knowing nothing about it...and slowly but surely I'm figuring the universe out...and now you're telling me that every viewpoint and every preference that I have is really just me choosing from the rituals and structures of an incredibly narrow set of cultural parameters, set up not to be able to understand the universe but for the sake of monkeys being able to work together better? How did this happen?Well an early structuralist might respond by saying that it happened in many different ways. Still is happening, by the way...your particular expression of the culture has already been reinforced to you probably hundreds of times just today...and the interesting thing is: you would never see it happening if you weren't specifically looking for it... because, it lies underneath the world as you immediately perceive it at a surface level. But what happens when you look at things in the world around you through the lens of Semiotics?Let me slow down, real quick just to prime this discussion that we're about to have, one of the crucial things to remember from last time is that early structuralists are going to be following up on the work of Ferdinand De Sassure. De Sassure being the person credited with founding the field of Semiotics. Semiotics being the study of signs. Signs being things like words or pictures or many other things that act as a stand in for something else for the sake of us being able to communicate effectively. What we also talked about was how Ferdinand De Sassure saw each sign as being comprised of two primary parts: there's the signifier, which is the word or picture, the thing standing in for something else...and then there's the signified, which is the concept of the thing the signifier is referencing.Well building from there... when early structuralists... started applying this Semiotic approach towards deconstructing signs in their respective fields of study...what they start to realize is that communication is often not as simple as there being just a single signifier... attached to a single signified. It's not always as simple as our example from last time, there's the word \"cow\" and the concept of the four legged bovine creature in the field. That often times when we actually look at how signs are used in these complex fields of human study...a single signifier...can be attached to multiple different signifieds...a single word or a single sentence...may have a surface level meaning that it is trying to denote...but, as it's often said...there is a big difference between denotation and connotation...that beneath a surface level reading of what a particular sign is seeming to communicate, there's often layers upon layers of different meanings... meanings that on one hand, allow the complexity of the universe to appear intelligible to us, but on the other hand drastically narrow and distort the way we see reality.Let's explain this further because it's THIS insight that early structuralists stumble upon... that makes many of them become interested in specifically using this new Semiotic approach towards understanding... Mythology at a deeper level...and here's where they're coming from: what is the extent of the meaning that we can get out of a Mythological work? What I mean is...you can look at mythology in a number of different ways:\u00a0There's a sense in which somebody could read a story from mythology, and they could interpret that story entirely at a surface level. Take Orphism and the mythology of ancient Greece for example. Somebody can read those stories...and it is entirely possible for them to read them in a very surface level way...and they may interpret what they read as just a fun story about a dysfunctional pantheon of gods.\u00a0Almost like this story is a sort of Wikipedia for these primitive people of Greece that NEEDED some mythology like this to explain things for them. Oh, this is a story about this guy Zeus up in the clouds, he has a bag full of lightning bolts, and here's another story about Poseidon...God of the sea...don't want to make him mad. In other words, there's a sense in which someone can read these stories and think that they're just stories... or some sort of outdated, fairy tale account of the way the universe is...but there's another sense in which if you were to read mythology in this way...you'd be entirely missing the point, of mythology.That the true value and meaning of mythology is not in that surface level story about Zeus and Poseidon...no, there's a secondary message that's being delivered beneath the surface of the text, non-explicitly, and the onus is on the reader to interpret and understand that deeper message. Depending on the mythology you're reading, this message could be anything: it could be the origins of a particular group of people, the values of the culture in which the story is being written, take the story of Noah's Ark for example: somebody could read that story and interpret it entirely at a surface level: this is a story about some guy named Noah, God decides he's going to shake the etch a sketch and start over, so Noah needs to build an ark.But another way of looking at that story is that the primary meaning for someone to take away from it is not in the denotation...it's in the secondary story beneath the text, or in the language of Semiotics there's another layer of meaning that lies in an entirely different set of signifieds... that connect to the original signifiers... and that this isn't merely a story about a guy named Noah and an ark, there is a deeper meaning to this story that, for example, provides Christians with valuable insights about their relationship with God and how to be a good Christian...but it potentially goes even deeper than that though...maybe even deeper than the meaning it has for practicing Christians, there are messages written into this story that any human being alive can find value in. Some people might say...maybe this isn't a story about a diety drowning everything on the planet at all...that the mythological archetype of the \"flood\" is something that is not unique to this story...it spans across many different cultures and\u00a0mythological works to symbolize, at a deeper level of this text, the cycle of death and rebirth that nature inevitably throws our way as human beings...that anyone listening to this can come up with countless different ways that, tomorrow, nature could send some cataclysmic event our way that humanity would ostensibly want to survive, as we have throughout history, and that this story is something that can inform that process. That maybe it's not literally about a guy named Noah that sacrifices animals to God to earn his favor, maybe that process of sacrifice, at a deeper level of this story, is depicting how personal sacrifice is the only thing that can temper you into the kind of person that isn't instantly ruined by events that test you and are out of your control. Maybe it's not about building a boat...maybe building the boat is a metaphor for building the means by which you're going to survive this cataclysmic event before it actually happens. Now even if this is a horrible take on Noah's Ark, you can understand the point here. Often times within mythology there are multiple signifieds attached to the original signifiers. There are the actual words that tell a very surface level story, but to only read it at that level would be missing out on a lot of the intended meaning of the work that lies, in a sense, beneath the surface level text.Now this is an extremely obvious point to us when it comes to mythology and things that clearly are written with a deeper meaning in mind...but the really important thing many structuralists would say we should all remember here: consider the possibility that you can go every single day of your life... reading mythology just at that very surface level...never realizing all the other layers there are...the reason this is so important to US in particular is because, you know... there's this very modern idea that's pretty popular, that as a species, when it comes to mythology...we're pretty much past all that. Mythology's this thing people used to do a long time ago to be able to explain the way the world is...but in today's world we have much more advanced and sophisticated ways of talking about things and quite frankly we don't have to resort to these archaic methods used in mythology that are obviously distorted, obviously oversimplified, we're past that as a species.Well one of the early structuralists by the name of Roland Barthes is going to say that the idea that we are in some sort of post-mythological age is complete and utter nonsense. See, to Barthes, mythology...is an extremely human thing to create and be engaged in...we do it all the time whether we realize it or not...and it's not that mythology no longer exists in our modern world...it's that the average person is so immersed within the mythology, the culture and our daily lives so saturated with a hidden, secondary story telling us the way the world is...that much like an average citizen of ancient Greece that might see a lightning bolt and confidently attribute that to Zeus...we do the very same sort of thing with our world and our mythology. And just like it's possible to go your whole life reading the mythology of ancient Greece at a very basic, surface level...you can go your entire life in our modern world interpreting everything that you see around you at a surface level, never realizing the deeper, secondary level story that you're blindly accepting as \"just the way the world is.\"See Roland Barthes would say, again...it's not that mythology doesn't exist in our modern world...it's that the delivery method of it has changed. Most people aren't going to some giant book filled with epic poetry about a pantheon of gods to get their mythology in this day and age...no, to Roland Barthes, the mythology of OUR world... is typically delivered to people through mass media. Because really consider the similarities between the two mediums when you look at them through the lens of semiotics like these early structuralists did...a dusty, old tome that contains mythology... is really just a vast collection of signs...hundreds of pages of signifiers that denote a surface level meaning but that also have multiple layers of signifieds attached to them that it's the reader's job to interpret...well the same thing is the case with the media we consume. For example, take your average TV news broadcast in today's world...for the sake of the example, if it's possible within your own political beliefs, picture the news broadcast you most disagree with, whether it's CNN, Fox News, doesn't matter...well what is that news broadcast REALLY when you look at it using Semiotics? Well, it's just a vast collection of signs...signs that on one level deliver a surface message of reporting the news of the day...but as you can see when you really analyze the specific signs and the calculated ways that CNN or Fox News are using them...there's often layers of mythology not being explicitly stated...and this mythology spans from things that are seemingly innocent like messages that reinforce their credibility as a news source...to messages that make value judgments about whose opinions should be taken seriously, all the way to mythology that makes brazen assumptions about what it even is to exist...all of these messages... shaping, distorting and narrowing people's views on the way the world is.Picture the typical signs that are presented to people in a news broadcast. And now the five o'clock news. Sweeping camera shot, there's music playing with a lot of beeping or a sense of urgency about it...Roland Barthes would really want us to ask ourselves, why is it that music in particular? What deeper story is being delivered to people there through that music? More signs are delivered to us: the camera brings into view a big room with two people sitting behind a desk dressed up in respectable clothes...why the desk? Why those clothes in particular? Why do they have incredible posture? Why is that giant picture behind them, why are they looking directly into the camera lens as though they're looking you in the eye when they give you the news, why do they talk in a very specific, articulation and diction that is the way that somebody talks when they deliver you the news? See everything about the five o'clock news that's being presented to you is a vast collection of signs, and just like classic mythology, this combination of signs can be taken at a surface level and just glossed over, but to look at the news that way would be missing out on a lot of deeper stories that are being told to the viewers non-explicitly. Roland Barthes would say that peppered throughout this entire broadcast...is a mythology that's being communicated to you that what these people on the television screen are telling you is total, unmediated reality.Barthes would want to break it down even further though, even down to details that may seem completely insignificant at a surface level...for example, what's with all the scrolling text? Really, why is it that scrolling text is so popular on programs that deliver the news? Is it just a really efficient way of delivering a message to people? Or does the scrolling of the text add a little something to the way we perceive the information? For example, does scrolling text look a little more like an official bulletin that people should take seriously? Does it add to the viewer a feeling that the information is hot off the press because look, it just came into existence on the left side of my screen a couple seconds ago and I better read it because it's not gonna be around for long! Roland Barthes would say that we often look at the font of a message as sort of just a disinterested vehicle for delivering that message...but in reality, he would say, the font that something is written in... adjusts and changes the meaning of what its conveying. There's a very good reason the newspaper isn't written in comic sans. And understanding why that is...understanding the deeper mythology there that's brought to bear even when it comes to something as seemingly insignificant as the font that's being used, can help us understand the goal of Roland Barthes during this portion of his career when he's analyzing mass media. That is: to demystify culture for the average viewer.We have been collectively mystified by this mythology that exists in media, and it's mystified us by doing what Barthes says it's so effective at doing: mythology transforms history into nature. And what he means by that is, look Barthes is an anti-essentialist. To him there is no such thing as some essential \"way the world is\" that we're accessing through media...or at least no validity when people say essentialist things like \"that's just the way people are\" or \"that's just the way Americans are\" or any number of countless examples you could bring up. What mythology does is turn history into nature, it takes these cultural constructions, like for example the idea of \"how americans are\"...a construction that is ultimately arbitrary and completely contingent upon history, or what happens to have transpired in the past...and mythology gets people to look at that construction as though it's a fixed, unchanging part of nature...as though the way that you look at the world and make sense of it is \"just the way the world is\".Because here's the thing...back to CNN and Fox News for a second... Barthes would say there are a lot of people out there that are really good at spotting the mythology of people they disagree with...but when you ask them about their OWN worldview...oh, well my views are just the way the world is. That just goes without saying. Barthes says it's right there that you're always going to find mythology. Whenever someone says something like \"it goes without saying\" or \"it's just the way the world is\"...that's always an area where someone is loaded up with mythological baggage that they don't realize they're carrying around with them.This is the crucial point to understand about this mythology.\u00a0The goal is not to do away with mythology... or become a person that looks at the world in a way devoid of mythology...to many structuralists, you can't escape mythology...to have an understanding of this universe at all is to have a mythology that you subscribe to that gives you a yes, narrow, but at least comprehensible picture that if you never thought about it may seem to you like just \"the way the world is\". The goal isnt to get rid of the mythology but to demystify your own personal mythology so that you can see it for what it actually is.What he ALSO wants people to realize through this is that when you look at mass media through the lens of semiotics, what becomes immediately obvious to you is how quickly we move, as he says, from Semiology to Ideology. Semiology is the original name Ferdinand De Sassure wanted to use, but it's more popularly known as Semiotics. What Barthes is saying is that when you use Semiotics to uncover these second and third level meanings hidden in media, what you find is almost always mythology that promotes a particular political ideology, and by \"political ideology\" he's not just talking about liberal vs. conservative, his scope is much broader, by political he means any message that aims to change something about the world in some way...so this is not just CNN or Fox News doing this stuff, but advertisements, books, YouTube channels, podcasts, practically every, input we receive from the media landscape.\u00a0To Barthes, the entire world around you is a mythological work that needs to be interpreted...and when you can spot the mythology that underlies even the most seemingly innocent things in media you can start to see all of the assumptions we bring to the table that have massive effects on the way the average person thinks, behaves, votes, the way they structure their viewpoint of reality.Now I want to repeat this because I want to make sure this is entirely clear...what Barthes is NOT doing here is telling people...hey when you're watching TV...if you pay attention... you can spot people in media that say things that are politically biased! Be careful for all that mythology they might throw your way!No he's actually saying something much more fundamental and extraordinary than that. What he's saying is... when you use Semiotics to look at this mythology hidden within media, if you dig deep enough...this mythology... is an entry point towards exhuming the deep rooted, underlying structures, that make up our culture, the structures that allow our culture to function at all.Let me say that another way, what Barthes is uncovering is the very structure, of our culture and what makes it work. He's uncovering the oversimplified stories we tell ourselves every day...that act as the fabric that holds society together. Remember last episode when we were talking about how language and words only work when they're arranged in a very specific structure? Well many structuralists believed that culture worked the same way, that as human beings we formulate cultures using the exact same patterns we use to formulate languages. That like every language, every culture has a complex arrangement of social structures that allow society to function. Barthes, by using Semiotics to dissect the media we consume and get to the mythology that's being implied but not said, what he's actually uncovering there are the various structures of culture that most people never notice are there. Barthes would say, the same way you can easily talk to people all day long and make sentences and you don't necessarily need to understand Semiotics or the complexities of grammar to be able to do that...you can be engaged in this mythology, with every viewpoint that you have, and you can be completely unaware of the narrow cultural structures that lie underneath the stuff that you're watching. This is what Barthes means when he says he wants to \"demystify culture\" for people. He wants to show people culture for what it truly is.So let's talk about several specific examples that Barthes gives. Now we could immediately dive into the obviously coercive mythology, but I think one of the best places to start, just because it's such a normal, everyday part of the way we navigate existence, is to talk about the mythology that pervades the way the average person looks at soap.Yes, that's right. Soaps and detergents. Bear with me for this example, I promise it will make sense...here's where he's coming from: when you look at the denotation of soap, what is it really? Well on a surface level it's just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles. But we don't see it as just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles, do we?Barthes says in a sort of tongue in cheek way, there's a spirituality that comes along with soap, a mythology that we've added on\u00a0to those clean smelling bubbles that affect the way we think about how soap fits into our lives...and we can see all of this extra meaning we tack onto soap when we look at the way advertisers try to sell it to us. Think of the language that's often used when describing soap...we almost see it as this holy weapon that we're using to fight against the demon of uncleanliness....and advertisers will talk about soap using language that makes it sound like a weapon...this weapon cuts through dirt like a sword...destroys grunge and grime at the source almost like some sort of cleaning artillery...tackles any mess with ease using our patented \"foaming cleanser\"...we actually talk about cleansing away filth the same way someone of a different culture and time may talk about cleansing a house of an evil spirit...think of the images on the TV screen of the dinner plate half dirty with food all over it, half glistening white, or on a deeper level, half tainted by this evil curse known as \"filth\" and dirtiness...and half restored to the rightful, natural state of purity that it belongs in, that this soap has delivered to you. The idea that we accept there being: look, there are going to be times in your life... when evil rears its ugly head...filth and dirtiness are going to corrupt the things you care about in your life...maybe it's your kitchen table, maybe it's your clothes, maybe it's your car, but eventually, the time will come that you need to take this soap...this soap that kills 99.9% of bacteria... and you need to carry out a bacteria holocaust in your kitchen to cleanse your life and restore it to a state of purity. Soap will get you there. Forged in the crucible of the Pine Sol factory...your kitchen table's deliverance from the corruption of filth awaits you down at the grocery store.Now this sounds completely ridiculous when we use these words and talk about it as though it is some sort of religious cleansing, but that doesn't mean this isn't the way the utility of soap functions in our daily lives. Barthes would say the fact we always talk about soap in standard, everyday language is a big part of the reason we're capable of normalizing the way we use soap, never noticing all the mythology we attach to it, and just accepting it as, again, just \"the way the world is\". But here's the reality, he would say: the way we look at soap...is not as just a bunch of clean smelling bubbles...things in my life that matter to me get dirty, and soap is the catalyst by which I return those things to their rightful, clean place where they belong! In other words...there seems to be a way that we STRUCTURE our lives by looking at things in terms of whether they are clean or dirty, and most of us gladly accept, that that's just the way the world is. Remember that structure for next episode, but the point here is not to criticize soap, or the people who use soap...the point is to show people how even with something as simple as soap, there is this entirely different level of signifieds, a deeper level of meaning that we attach to clean smelling bubbles that certainly helps us navigate our lives, but that meaning doesn't say anything necessarily true about those bubbles objectively.Now some of you out there might be saying...ok, who cares?...it's soap....and I get it...it IS just soap...the stakes are not exactly life threatening here...but they're not supposed to be...that is the whole strategy! Talking about something as benign and politically uncharged as soap...is Barthes using an extremely obvious, uncontroversial example just to illustrate to anyone that this mythology exists. So now that we know it does exist, let's talk about examples of how this mythology can be enormously helpful or horribly damaging to people, sometimes simultaneously. Probably the most famous example is when Roland Barthes uses semiotics to give an analysis of professional wrestling.Now by professional wrestling, he's not talking about greco-roman or olympic wrestling...he's talking about stuff like the WWE...big dudes in speedos beating each other with chairs...screaming at each other...pretending to writhe in pain on the ground...the outcome is planned before the start of the match...somebody could look at professional wrestling and ask the question unless if you're into this stuff, who outside of a seven year old kid could possibly get any value out of this? But Barthes would say if that's really the way you're looking at wrestling, you're entirely missing the point of wrestling. Once again, let's all notice the pattern here: the people that look at the media landscape, and for that matter the world around them at an entirely at a basic, surface level, are going to be missing out on a lot of deeper meaning that's not obvious...looking at wrestling this way is this is the equivalent of reading Greek Mythology and just thinking it's a story about Zeus and Poseidon. The true meaning that people are connecting with when they're watching professional wrestling has nothing to do with the surface level of guys beating each other with chairs...the mistake that someone's making if they see it that way is that they're looking at wrestling as though the point of it is for there to actually be a competition, when in reality wrestling is a spectacle, that's goal is to deliver very specific messages to people about morality.To show why this is the case, he compares boxing and wrestling. The purpose of a boxing match, is to figure out who the best boxer is. You'd never writhe in pain on the ground if someone punched you. You'd never be losing a boxing match and then decide you're going to leave the ring, get a chair, beat your opponent senseless with it, then get up on the high rope with their lifeless body and body slam them into a Buick parked next to the stage. You just wouldn't do that because a big part of a boxing match is that the rules dictate who wins the boxing match. When it comes to wrestling, Barthes says the only reason why the rules are there is to serve as guidelines to be broken by whoever the bad guy is. I mean really, the only reason the rules even exist is to inspire outrage in the crowd when they're broken. Wrestling is not a sport, it is a drama. The wrestlers are all characters, huge people, cartoonishly huge at times, characters thrown into playing moral roles that deliver a wide variety of messages to people, one of the major recurring ones being that justice is being delivered in the world. The bad guy may win. He may get away with what he's doing five times, ten times...but there's always going to be that day when the bad guy gets his comeuppance. Barthes would say that a big part of what people are communicating with is the fact that bad people do exist out there...but here's proof, in some way, that law and order and justice are still being delivered in this crazy world.Now this function within culture has been served by many other things all throughout history. Public executions. Did the human beings of the past hang people and chop off their heads in the public square because people are sadistic and just really like watching people die? Or does the cultural ritual of justice being carried out in public on criminals help keep people voluntarily participating in this chaotic game that involves us banding together for mutual benefit? So in that sense, this mythology delivered to people by professional wrestling, is part of the very fabric that holds culture together, you could say if you were foreshadowing to next episode that it's a very small part of a much larger structure that holds society together. Barthes likes wrestling in particular because yes, it's fake, yes, it's delivering mythology to people, but at least it doesn't pretend like it's anything other than that... like so many other programs out there do.Now at first glance it seems great that something as simple as professional wrestling is delivering messages to people that help hold society together. That definitely seems like a good thing, but Barthes would strongly suggest that we take a second and think about the potential downsides of something like that. Hypothetically, you can use media to deliver to people a message that helps hold society together, much to the detriment of society. Barthes would say, picture someone in a place of enormous political power, a politician. Maybe they have a friend that owns a media company too. How easy would it be for that person... to create a show that delivers to people this message that law and order and justice are being carried out in the world around them, just as a cover so that the politician and their friends at the top levels of government can rake the citizenry over the coals, rob them blind, destroy the country and never have to face any sort of meaningful outrage from people, because most of the population have been sold this marketing campaign that they're living in a just country? What if in reality, the purpose of public executions was to terrify anyone into submission, who might otherwise dare to rebel against the status quo?When you're clever enough to deliver to people a mythology... that gets people to confidently say something as reductionist as, \"that's just the way the world is and it goes without saying.\" Imagine the conditions you could get them to live in.We'll continue this discussion next episode. Thank you for listening. I'll talk to you next time."
