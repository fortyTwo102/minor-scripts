    "spoken_text": "This is a transcript of episode #103\u00a0on Sartre. Check out the episode page HERE.So if you don't follow the show on Facebook or you don't follow me on Twitter you may be a little out of the loop in terms of the requests I've been receiving and what this show's gonna focus on for the next several episodes. So I wanna fill you in.You know, at the end of one of the Heidegger episodes I said that the state of the world is always contingent upon the state of human thought that came before it...and what I meant by that was...whether we realize it or not...every single one of us exists...as a single point...on a massive continuum...known as the history of human thought. Whether we realize it or not...so many of the strong convictions that we have... things that we think are parts of our personality and the personalities of people around us...have been shaped and in many ways determined... by the history of philosophical insights within this history of human thought.You know everybody has a particular way that they look at the world...a way that they look at economics and government and human psychology and God and relationships...and if you're an honest person this way of looking at things is always changing it's always growing...but the fact remains...at any one point in time... we all have a particular way that we look at the world that we've deemed to be a sort of best practices in that moment...and for years of MY life, at least, whenever I thought about this particular way that I looked at the world...I walked around talking about it like I had come up with it. Like it was all me, like as if at some point I locked myself in a closet and just thought about stuff REALLY REALLY hard for twenty years... and then emerged with MY way of looking at the world.But what I realized is that so much of the way we look at the world is actually this complex...patchwork...of philosophical insights that we've gleaned from the books that we've read, the teachers that we've had, the people that we've met, tons of different things, the point is...whether we realize it or not...we were all born into a particular philosophical...Facticity like we talked about last episode...and this Facticity greatly influences the way that we look at the world.Now maybe you've listened to this show before...maybe you've come across some thinker that embodies some aspect of the way that you look at the world, you know a single piece of that complex patchwork of ideas that you have. But just statistically speaking...if you're a human being alive in the year 2017...a significant portion of the way that you look at the world is going to be based on the main philosophical lines of thinking that occurred throughout the 20th century...and when you understand the origins of these philosophical lines of thinking...you're given...a pretty substantial gift that is two fold at least that's how it was for meFirst of all I felt humbled...because finally I didn't have to look at my set of beliefs as this elaborate art project I've been working on for twenty years...and if somebody criticizes my beliefs... they're essentially criticizing me...and second of all I felt this weird sense of clarity...because when you turn on the TV...and you see the way that people are behaving...and you take a step back in Plato's cave and you see the shadows on the cave wall for what they are...when you see what's going on as a sort of a ripple effect of a... philosophical stone that was thrown into a pond last century...it starts to all be way less confusing.This is the gift that I would like to give to you over the course of this next series of episodes...and when I thought about where to begin...the first thing I realized we're going to need is a much deeper understanding of Sartre...much deeper than we got on the...you know, the one episode I did on him where I touched briefly on Freedom and Responsibility. Look bottom line is, to fully understand his concept of radical freedom and responsibility, we have to understand his Phenomenology...to understand his phenomenology we have to understand Husserl and to understand Husserl...we have to understand a long standing, quasi-annoying tradition in the history of philosophy, that people were starting to get very skeptical of around the time of Sartre and Husserl.This episode is a story from philosophy that I'd like to tell you. It's a story to bring context to everything we've learned so far...context I could never give when I was just doing an episode on these thinkers in chronological order...but nonetheless it's context we NEED...to be able to understand the questions that Sartre thought were worth answering during his time.The story begins with Descartes...godfather of modern philosophy...now in many ways, the story of Descartes is as old as philosophy itself...he's a mathematician turned philosopher...a mathematician fascinated by the level of certainty we can have when we say things like 1+1 = 2, and he wants to try to emulate this process of mathematical certainty and apply it to thinking the goal being: to arrive at certainty about things.You know, in his book Rules For The Direction of the Mind, he talks about taking clear and distinct propositions and linking them together in the same sort of way a mathematician might say something like: ok well 1+1=2. Alright now 2 + 5 = 7. we know that. Ok now 7 x 4 = 28. Alright now lets bracket all these clear and distinct propositions together that have allowed us to progress up until this point...now imagine this same method... applied to thinking...except instead of chaining numbers, you're chaining together clear and distinct ideas arriving at a level of certainty comparable to 7 x 4 = 28. That was the goal...at least.See it's important to understand where Descartes coming from with all this...Descartes takes a look back at the almost 2000 years of philosophy that had been done before he was alive, and he's embarrassed..quite frankly. Nobody agrees on anything...nobody has any sort of solid foundation for what they're writing...it's all just a bunch of smart people spewing out volume after volume of unverifiable speculation about things...is this really what we want philosophy to be?Descartes thinks that where these philosophers all wen't wrong is in their method...and by the way this same exact sentiment applies more generally just to us in our personal lives...but he says that it's so easy to fall into the trap...where you're super interested in something...you want to feel like you know about a topic so badly...that you research it and think about it for a while and you talk to people about it...and then this strange, very human, thirst for knowledge... takes over...you want to feel like you know about it so badly that you end up getting impatient... and just ASSUMING that you know everything about it when there was really a lot more to consider if you dug deeper. You know to continue the math metaphor...this is like you want to be done with the test so badly.. that you just write a bunch of answers that seem like they're about right, but you don't actually go through and show your work of exactly how you got there.Well, enough of that. Enough speculation, enough chaos in philosophy, we need CERTAINTY about things. And Descartes thought if we are ever going to arrive at certainty about things...we need to be taking a much more RIGOROUS look at the METHODS that we're using to arrive at it...he even uses that word, you know he often talks about how philosophy should be looked at as what he calls a rigorous discipline...and what we've been doing so far...uh, it's been FAR from rigorous. So Descartes lays down the guantlet. From this point forward...let's all just agree on a couple things. Under penalty of being laughed at, cast out of the room and relegated to the childrens table at the next family reunion...a philosopher truly concerned with the quest for certainty shall henceforth never make any claim that is not: 1, so clear that there is nothing obscure about it and 2, so distinct that there is nothing confused about it.Clear and distinct. As clear and distinct as 1+1=2...you know you can imagine some of these hypothetical chains of ideas linked together by these earlier philosophers...you can imagine propositions within their thinking that look to Descartes like 2+2=5...and then what happens is all the rest of the ideas that are built on top of that proposition.... come crumbling down. This is what has happened all throughout history...this is the world Descartes is living in...and here's him throwing down the gauntlet... trying to make sure it never has to happen again.We need to arrive at certainty. But here's the thing about certainty...it's no joke. It's not enough to just say 2+2...is basically 4.01...no, there's no close enough when it comes to certainty. And if were TRULY going to be rigorous...if we're going to arrive at a philosophical system based on certainty...we need to build it completely from scratch we can't assume ANYTHING about it... just as a given.Descartes says we need to doubt everything even things... that may seem a little bit silly when you're initially doubting them...things, for example, like whether or not we actually exist. Can't even take THAT for granted. And lucky for Descartes he gets past that one pretty easily with his famous I think, therefore I am. See if you're Descartes... and many philosophers before him for that matter... the c riteria for knowing something clearly and distinctly... lies in whether we have direct a awareness of it, rather than some secondary level of awareness of it... given to us by some other source, For example.To Descartes...when we ask the question whether or not we actually exist...simply based on the observation that we're thinking about anything at all...to him, at the very least, we must be some sort of thinking thing that exists...in other words...we have this sort of... direct awareness of our existence present within our minds. But as you can imagine...not everything is this straight forward...even things that may seem...very straightforward.Because on the other hand, to Descartes, take something like the existence of the physical world,...I mean, sure it looks like there's a physical world out there full of things that we're interacting with...but can we be certain... about the things that we're looking at? After all, we know our minds trick us all the time...right? I mean you get stranded in the desert long enough...dehydrated...it happens...you start hallucenating...you start seeing a McDonalds on the horizon...that McDonalds isn't actually there...you put a stick in some water, the stick looks bent, but the stick isn't actually bent.The conclusion here, Descartes says, is that when it comes to the existence of the external world...we're not directly aware of the things that exist in the world...we're only directly aware of the way that they appear to us...or the phenomena as they appear to us...important word there...in this story from history...phenomena.In other words if we want to stay in keeping with this rigorous criteria that Descartes laid out trying to get to certainty about things, all we can really give with certainty... is a description of the phenomena...not the actual external objects of world. Though, Descartes himself never talks about this process of describing phenomena, he just marks the distinction between phenomena and the objects of the world...that's his contribution...Now this idea...that we are something that's aware of our own existence that can't be certain about anything else OUTSIDE of our own existence...is a textbook example of way of looking at things that in philosophy is referred to as Solipsism. Now Descartes never would have looked at himself as a champion of Solipsism...he has ways around it...he had an argument where the existence of God was a certainty and that therefore, God would never deceive us by putting all these thoughts in our heads about a world existing if there wasn't actually one...but, uh...everyone else wasn't buying that. And I guess the important part is: Descartes got us back on track...he laid down the guantlet of certainty. Finally, for the first time ever, philosophy had been turned into a truly rigorous discipline...and yeah, maybe Descartes didn't get too far at arriving at these clear and distinct propositions, but at least now, we're on the right track. Right?Well the story of philosophy goes on...time goes on. Thinkers come and go presenting theory after theory...and they certainly make some progress when it comes to these things that we can say with absolute certainty, but the next big breakthrough occurs... when a guy comes along that we've talked about many times on this show before: Mr. Immanuel Kant.Again, for the full explanation go back and listen to the Kant episodes... but because most of you probably already know what I'm talking about, here's the lighting round edition just to frame things in this discussion: All of us listening to this look at the world around us and see a world that is solid, static and unchanging...when in reality if we put that table in front of you under an electron microscope you'd see that it was 99.9% empty space and constantly moving. What this tells us... is that our senses... weren't necessarily evolved to be able to understand the fabric of reality itself...but really... just to be able to create a map of reality that does a good enough job that we can survive and reproduce better than others in a particular set of climate conditions.See, Descartes made a mistake in Kant's eyes. Descartes made the assumption that the mind didn't contribute anything to the phenomena it was looking at...he saw us as kind of passive observers just taking it all in. Kant on the other hand says that when you take a closer look at the mind... how it receives these phenomena, the mind actually contributes... a LOT to them.Kant says that for all intents and purposes...there are two distinct worlds that exist. There's the world of things in themselves...or the world out there...beyond our basic map of reality that we are reading with our senses...and then theres the world of human experience...which is our map of the world...or a world where our senses perceive these things in themselves and create phenomena that we organize through various mental faculties to be able to make sense of them...this whole process producing for us...our human experience of the world. In other words, we are ACTIVE observers organizing and governing the raw phenomena, not just taking them in...and to Kant, we can never know anything about this world of things in themselves...only the world of human experience.But the NEXT chapter in the story... is that you have post-Kantians coming along saying, ok...well if we can't ever know anything about this world of things in themselves...how can we know for certain that there's more than one thing responsible for all these phenomena? How can we know that these things actually cause the phenomena...isn't causality a category of the mind? Actually...how can we know for certain that this world of things in themselves exists at all?And the answer is folks, at this point in philosophy: we can't. This is why Kant is referred to as a Transcendental Idealist...he's one of the first members in the long standing tradition in philosophy known as Idealism...or the idea that all of reality, or at least as we can possibly know it... is non-material and a construction of the mind.<slow>In other words: We can't know for certain...we can't just assume that there are these material objects existing in some hypothetical external world... that are causing the phenomena we're experiencing. All that we can be certain about...is going on in our minds.Again, CERTAINTY is what we're going for...we have to adhere to this rigorous set of criteria descartes laid out.Now at this point some of you out there might be thinking...ok...what are we doing here? What EXACTLY are we doing with philosophy? Look, when Descartes questioned whether we really exist or not, it was a fun thought experiment...when Kant did it...I respected the mans tenacity. But at a certain point...what we can't KNOW whether physical things exist in the world? How ridiculous is that? What, did Kant's dad never take him aside sit him down and say son...you're upstairs in your room all day doing your fingerpainting questioning whether the world actually exists...news flash...it does...look see table...its real hey NEWS paper! look it's the classified section...now you can get a REAL job! oh it's real...you like THAT don't you!Now of course this isn't how it went...but it can start to make you think...look I admire the whole quest for certainty thing...I understand what you guys are trying to do and I appreciate it...but at a certain point: I have a life to lead. I have kids to play football with...I have a job to go to. I can't sit around all day wondering whether a material world actually exists or not...look I'm all for certainty...and I understand you may be right, we may only have our thoughts...the universe itself...may in fact be just one giant thought...but the fact that it's been this long and you can't even confirm.... one of the most intuitively obvious things about existence...I'm worried you might be wasting your time and more importantly...I'm worried you might be wasting MY time.Now if any of you have ever felt this way over the course of listening to this show: you're not alone. Because as the story continues...right around the 19th century thinkers started to emerge that were very skeptical of... not only this longstanding tradition of looking for certainty about things...but more generally... this long tradition of philosophers assuming that it's possible to use reason...to just...reason our way to the solutions about every problem we could ever face as a species. Reason to certainty about things, reason to the ideal form of government, reason to a complete scientific world picture.There was a sense at the time that this kind of thinking was... sort of outdated, kind of nostalgic, old philosophy...for so long we've tried to reduce everything into these pre-packaged little rational categories...and we've done it so much that these categories have become more important to philosophers than the things that make them up...even human beings for example...I mean, along with this old philosophy went an outdated way of rationally categorizing human beings...this long tradition of seeing people as merely aspects of some larger whole...as merely children of God's kingdom...or merely members of a state...out went that way of thinking... and we started to see thinkers emerge like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche... that looked at what it is to be a human being much more in terms of what it is to be an individual...a relatively modern concept in human history.Now of course this wasn't the only way people were looking at the history of philosophy, but this is the way Sartre was looking at it: there was this feeling... that maybe this trajectory of philosophy brought about in the 17th century... had been off the rails for a long time and was utterly devoid of value...there was this feeling that if we ever wanted to make ANY sort of progress in the future we needed to do something radical...something fundamentally different than we have been doing.Then along comes a character into history to shake things up...the mad scientist philosopher Husserl...early in his career on the same page as these 19th century thinkers that believe something radical needs to be done...and this is EXACTLY what he's trying to do with his early work. He's not SATISFIED with idealism being some sort of final destination...he wants to tweak our methods of looking at these phenomena, study the very structure of consciousness and arrive at a certainty that includes an external, physical world among other things.In other words: this rigorous discipline of philosophy... just got an extreme makeover. And yeah Husserl would agree...you definitely don't want to spend every second of your life doubting whether the external world exists or not just because philosophers haven't arrived at some definitive proof of it. That'd be ridiculous I mean just think if everybody adopted that strategy...nobody in that history of the world would have ever conducted a single scientific experiment...how can you do an experiment on a world that you have no reason to believe actually exists?Think about that...just imagine if we never conducted science just because philosophy had never arrived at a method that was going to guarantee we were never mistaken. No, science doesn't agonize over the idea of never being mistaken like Descartes did...science isn't in the business of certainty...it's in the business of coming up a yes largely incomplete, tremendously flawed but PROFOUNDLY USEFUL set of insights that help us understand things a little bit better. Just because it's not certainty doesn't make it not useful...and again in a weird way... if scientists WERE out there looking for complete certainty, they wouldn't be able to get anything done.Husserl makes a distinction between these two very different ways of orienting yourself to the world...BOTH OF WHICH are useful in his eyes. On one hand we have the Phenomenological attitude sometimes called the philosophical attitude...this is Descartes Gauntlet...this is the rigorous method of looking for certainty that Husserl's made drastic improvements upon...the, I guess, 100% honest way of looking at things doubting everything including your own existence and then proceeding with caution from there...there's that and then on the other hand we have what he calls the Natural Attitude...or the sort of default way of orientating yourself to the world...the way of looking at things that all science is conducted through...or as Husserl says the way of looking at things that starts with several big presuppositions but nonetheless allows us to continue on with our daily lives or scientific inquiry without being paralyzed by this quest for certainty.These are two different ways of approaching the world. Scientists don't doubt the kind of things Husserl doubts when he's looking for certainty... they don't doubt things like whether there's actually a correspondence between the thoughts they're having and the object they're perceiving...they don't DOUBT things like whether the mind is the kind of thing that's even capable of arriving at OBJECTIVE FACTS...yet they conduct scientific experiments assuming these things are in their favor...and it makes sense...Husserl would say... that it's just simply not useful when you're doing a scientific experiment to doubt whether the mind is something even capable of arriving at objectivity...if you get too caught up on certainty...it sabotages your very ability to do science. Science is not certainty.This is the point Husserl's making. The phenomenological attitude and the natural attitude are mutually exclusive. You can't look at the world in both ways simultaneously. For example, a normal everyday person immersed in the natural attitude... might go down to the library pick up some Husserl...they might read him... they might contemplate how they can know anything for certain...maybe they even employ a few of his methods and take a sort of recreational swim in the Phenomenological attitude. But when they're done reading the book, they leave the library and go on about their day...they're not still doubting whether the world actually exists or not. On that same note...even the most die hard Phenomenologist...let's say you work 9-5 as a professional Phenomenologist...the second that bell rings and you take your union standardized break...you're not sitting around the break room wondering whether the vending machine is just a mental construction or not.Practicing Phenomenology is practicing a new way of seeing the world and the things that make seeing the world possible at all...and Husserl would say...yeah it's possible for someone to get too far down the rabbit hole of the philosophical attitude...sitting around all day yellin' at people, well YOU don't even know if any of this stuff exists...so PROVE it! YOU don't even know if YOU exist! And that certainly would be a waste of time...but be careful cause you can go too far in the other direction too...you can spend your entire life writing off these sort of... pointless armchair philosopher questions and going on for the rest of your days...never really considering all the presuppositions that come along with the natural attitude.. and honestly believing that what you're looking at as you walk around every day is OBJECTIVE reality. There are people that talk about what we see as human beings as though it is...objective reality.Example everyone will know: there are certain big famous, celebrity proponents of science who are.. by their own admission...proudly willfully ignorant of philosophy who say that philosophy is essentially useless in today's world..because it's been replaced by a better, more dynamic system called science... that does everything philosophy used to do except better.These people are a perfect example... of what it looks like to go way too far down the rabbit hole of the natural attitude...I mean does Bill Nye realize that if it wasn't for philosophy he would just be Bill Nye...the guy. I mean seriously. But Bill Nye, NDT, Stephen Hawking, all these people that are proud of the fact they've never read philosophy... and they cavalierly just in normal conversation throw around these terms like Objective Reality and Objective Truth and Facts...one of a few things has to be true about them...either they've never considered the limitations of their own senses...the limitations of human knowledge...the assumptions present in the natural attitude...which given how little philosophy they've claimed to have read is worrying...or the more charitable reading of this...the reading I force myself to believe as I sit in the corner and neurotically rocking...is that maybe they have considered all these boundaries between themselves and objectivity...but they use words like Objective Truth because they see themselves engaged in a war against religion and they feel like they have to be a direct substitute to it.In other words...maybe it's all a strategy...maybe they're not so lost in the natural attitude...maybe they see that human beings are really attracted to this idea of having all the answers and of harnessing objective truth...and religion tells them they can find those answers in the book of genesis...so in order to compete with that...let's sort of gloss over all the limitations of science and the human beings that ultimately have to conduct science and let's proceed as though our method is the REAL method of arriving at Objective truth. What I'm saying is...when you go too far down this natural attitude rabbit hole and you start looking at this stuff as though it's objective truth...it starts to look eerily familiar. You know in the 1400's you had a priest that wore a big robe and conducted a ritual at an altar spoke to God and told you what the objective truth of the universe was. In today's world you have a scientist...wearing a big robe (labcoat)...conducting a ritual (experiement) at an altar (a labratory) speaking to the universe and telling you the objective truth about it is.You never go full Natural Attitude...is what I'm saying.But back to the story...as you can imagine...when word gets out that Husserl's come up with a new method of Phenomenology that may give us certainty about an external, physical world and much more by the way...it attracts a lot of aspiring philosophers that see it as one piece of this radical change that we're going to have to make in philosophy if we want to move forward...one of these thinkers that became a student of Husserl was named Martin Heidegger...another was named Jean Paul Sartre.Now... in an unexpected turn of events...a turn that many of Husserl's students couldn't even fully understand...right around the middle of Husserl's life he does sort of an about face with his Phenomenology...he takes it in the same direction so many other thinkers before him took it...he loses faith in his work and becomes an Idealist.Now some students followed along with Husserl adopting his new work...but other students were like, mm..no. No, no. Sure, Husserl this early work is far from perfect...but look all it needs is a little more development in this area and some further clarifications over there... and then...then it's gonna be solid. Two of the thinkers that were part of this group...were Heidegger and Sartre.Now Heidegger...as we talked about...disagreed with some pretty critical aspects of Husserl...not the least of which was the entire idea of consciousness at all. Again, why do we need to think about ourselves like Descartes did back in the 17th century? Like we're subjects acting upon objects...or a more modern spin...consciousness acting upon things in the world? No, to Heidegger... we have no reasonable basis for making that sort of assumption. Being... and the world... are a unified thing and are fundamentally inseparable from eachother.Well Sartre reads Heidegger and he's convinced...Heidegger's right... we have no basis for assuming that we're subjects acting upon objects...he's right that being and the world are a unified thing...but Sartre leaves room for consciousness. To Sartre...it's consciousness...and the world...that are fundamentally inseparable.See Sartre takes a look at this long history in philosophy we've been talking about for this entire episode and he realizes something...the problem everyone seems to have... is being able to explain how things work up in this strange...box inside of their head that they seem to be trapped in. They have this factory up in their heads called consciousness or whatever word they use for it...and they have this receiving dock that takes in these semi-trucks full of phenomena... and these phenomena are sent down conveyor belts and the disenfranchised blue collar workers organize them and categorize them and turn them into this crude map of the world that they ship out the other side of the factory to us so we can perceive the world.But think about what we talked about last time...consciousness is not some empty container...or some empty factory up in our heads waiting to be filled up with perceptions. The more these Phenomenologists look at consciousness the more they see it more of an activity than a thing up in our heads...remember consciousness is always actional (doing something) and referential (pointing towards something)...there's no such thing as some empty consciousness out there.See Sartre is different from Husserl. When Husserl does his Phenomenology... he's super focused on the task of figuring out what everything is...and the way he DOES that is through various methods like the Eidetic Reduction that we talked about on Heidegger part 1.What... Husserl's interested in doing...is describing things in the world in terms of these universal essences that he arrives at through the Eidetic reduction...but remember... Sartre doesn't come from that school of thought he would see this whole process as just a misguided extension of this outdated, old philosophy where we thought we could think about everything in terms of these neat categories and universals. No, Sartre's more focused on the individual...and he thinks you can't ever know everything about an individual simply by looking at them in terms of what universal essences intersect by them.For example...you know it's so tempting to think that if we figure out the essence of something...we know what it is...that if we had a piece of wax...we did the Eidetic reduction and arrived at it's universal essences...that we have essentially figured out...what it is to be that thing. But Sartre says, this never tells us the full story. Sartre has a famous argument in his most famous work Being and Nothingness... where he quotes a passage from the biography of the French Author Gustave Flaubert...and here he's pointing out how ridiculous it is that the biographer is trying to explain the psychology of Flaubert, the psychology of a human being by using this sort of process...by just appealing to a bunch of universals.He says:\"\u2026 A critic, for example, wishing to explain the \u201cpsychology\u201d of Flaubert,will write that he \u201cappeared in his early youth to know as his normal state,a continual exaltation resulting from the twofold feeling of his grandioseambition and his invincible power \u2026. The effervescence of his youngblood was then turned into literary passion as happens about theeighteenth year in precocious souls who find in the energy of style or theintensities of fiction some way of escaping from the need of violent actionor of intense feeling, which torments them.\"So you can see what the biographers trying to do here...he's trying to give his own psychoanalysis of Gustave Flaubert and the things that happened in his youth that caused him to get into writing.Sartre goes on:\"In this passage there is an effort to reduce the complex personality of anadolescent to a few basic desires, as the chemist reduces compound bodiesto merely a combination of simple bodies. The primitive givens will begrandiose ambition, the need of violent action and of intense feeling; theseelements, when they enter into combination, produce a permanentexaltation.\"Listen to that...look at that comparison he draws...we're trying to break this person down... the same methodical way a chemist reduces compound bodies to merely a combination of simple bodies. He says:\"At each state in the description just quoted, we meet with a hiatus. Whydid ambition and the feeling of his power produce in Flaubert exaltationrather than tranquil waiting or gloomy impatience? Why did this exaltationexpress itself specifically in the need to act violently and feel intensely? Orrather why does this need make a sudden appearance by spontaneousgeneration at the end of the paragraph? And why does this need instead ofseeking to appease itself in acts of violence, by amorous adventures, or indebauch, choose precisely to satisfy itself symbolically? And why doesFlaubert turn to writing rather than to painting or music for this symbolicsatisfaction; he could just as well not resort to the artistic field at all (thereis also mysticism, for example). \u201cI could have been a great actor,\u201d wroteFlaubert somewhere. Why did he not try to be one? In a word, we haveunderstood nothing; we have seen a succession of accidental happenings,of desire springing forth fully armed, one from the other, with nopossibility for us to grasp their genesis. \"This... brings us to the end of the story...to the place Sartre is writing his philosophy from. What if this old style of philosophy was severely misguided? What if understanding the universal essences of things isn't enough to fully understand them? What if we don't have some consciousness factory up in our heads with these mysterious phenomena that leave us unable to be certain about anything but ideas? What if consciousness and the world are a unified thing fundamentally inseparable?And when you think about it in that way...what if consciousness...is like shining a flashlight into a dark room revealing only a small portion of what would otherwise be concealed. Except it's more than that...imagine there was no flashlight causing the light rays. Metaphorically speaking...what if what we are...are the lightrays...revealing a portion of an otherwise dark room? Pure awareness of things in the world...what if the idea that we needed a flashlight or that there was a barrier between us and the world...what if that was an assumption we'd been making all along? And as we prepare for next episode when we'll talk more of the details of Sartre's phenomenology and more importantly how it effects how we should look at our selves, our lives and the things we care about...Sartre would want us to consider... what if we are consciousness...and what if consciousness...IS... radical freedom and responsibility. Thank you for listening, I'll talk to you next time."
